Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that leaders are uniquely positioned to do, because several obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working alone. For one thing, the fear of being left out of the loop can keep them glued to their enterprise social media. Individuals don't want to be or appear to be—isolated. For another, knowing what their teammates are doing provides a sense of comfort and security, because people can adjust their own behavior to be in harmony with the group. It's risky to go off on their own to try something new that will probably not be successful right from the start. But even though it feels reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected, it's better for the organization if they periodically go off and think for themselves and generate diverse—if not quite mature—ideas. Thus, it becomes the leader’s job to create conditions that are good for the whole by enforcing intermittent interaction even when people wouldn't choose it for themselves, without making it seem like a punishment.",breaking physical barriers and group norms that prohibit cooperation,having people stop working together and start working individually,encouraging people to devote more time to online collaboration,shaping environments where higher productivity is required,requiring workers to focus their attention on group projects,2

Historically, the professions and society have engaged in a negotiating process intended to define the terms of their relationship. At the heart of this process is the tension between the professions' pursuit of autonomy and the public’s demand for accountability. Society’s granting of power and privilege to the professions is premised on their willingness and ability to contribute to social well-being and to conduct their affairs in a manner consistent with broader social values. It has long been recognized that the expertise and privileged position of professionals confer authority and power that could readily be used to advance their own interests at the expense of those they serve. As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago, “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites.” Autonomy has never been a one-way street and is never granted absolutely and irreversibly.",전문직에 부여되는 자율성은 그에 상응하는 사회적 책임을 수반한다.,전문직의 권위는 해당 집단의 이익을 추구하는 데 이용되어 왔다.,전문직의 사회적 책임을 규정할 수 있는 제도 정비가 필요하다.,전문직이 되기 위한 자격 요건은 사회 경제적 요구에 따라 변화해 왔다.,전문직의 업무 성과는 일정 수준의 자율성과 특권이 부여될 때 높아진다.,1

In Kant’s view, geometrical shapes are too perfect to induce an aesthetic experience. Insofar as they agree with the underlying concept or idea—thus possessing the precision that the ancient Greeks sought and celebrated—geometrical shapes can be grasped, but they do not give rise to emotion, and, most importantly, they do not move the imagination to free and new (mental) lengths. Forms or phenomena, on the contrary, that possess a degree of immeasurability, or that do not appear constrained, stimulate the human imagination—hence their ability to induce a sublime aesthetic experience. The pleasure associated with experiencing immeasurable objects—indefinable or formless objects—can be defined as enjoying one’s own emotional and mental activity. Namely, the pleasure consists of being challenged and struggling to understand and decode the phenomenon present to view. Furthermore, part of the pleasure comes from having one’s comfort zone (momentarily) violated.",diversity of aesthetic experiences in different eras,inherent beauty in geometrically perfect shapes,concepts of imperfection in modern aesthetics,natural inclination towards aesthetic precision,aesthetic pleasure from things unconstrained,5

The world has become a nation of laws and governance that has introduced a system of public administration and management to keep order. With this administrative management system, urban institutions of government have evolved to offer increasing levels of services to their citizenry, provided through a taxation process and/or fee for services (e.g., police and fire, street maintenance, utilities, waste management, etc.). Frequently this has displaced citizen involvement. Money for services is not a replacement for citizen responsibility and public participation. Responsibility of the citizen is slowly being supplanted by government being the substitute provider. Consequentially, there is a philosophical and social change in attitude and sense of responsibility of our urban-based society to become involved. The sense of community and associated responsibility of all citizens to be active participants is therefore diminishing. Governmental substitution for citizen duty and involvement can have serious implications. This impedes the nations of the world to be responsive to natural and man-made disasters as part of global preparedness.",A Sound Citizen Responsibility in a Sound Government,Always Better than Nothing: The Roles of Modern Government,Decreased Citizen Involvement: A Cost of Governmental Services,Why Does Global Citizenship Matter in Contemporary Society?,How to Maximize Public Benefits of Urban-Based Society,3

In economic systems what takes place in one sector has impacts on another; demand for a good or service in one sector is derived from another. For instance, a consumer buying a good in a store will likely trigger the replacement of this product, which will generate ① demands for activities such as manufacturing, resource extraction and, of course, transport. What is different about transport is that it cannot exist alone and a movement cannot be stored. An unsold product can remain on the shelf of a store until bought (often with discount incentives), but an unsold seat on a flight or unused cargo capacity in the same flight remains unsold and cannot be brought back as additional capacity ③ later. In this case an opportunity has been ④ seized, since the amount of transport being offered has exceeded the demand for it.

When examining the archaeological record of human culture, one has to consider that it is vastly ______.

Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains.

The computer has, to a considerable extent, solved the problem of acquiring, preserving, and retrieving information. Data can be stored in effectively unlimited quantities and in manageable form. The computer makes available a range of data unattainable in the age of books. It packages it effectively; style is no longer needed to make it accessible, nor is memorization. In dealing with a single decision separated from its context, the computer supplies tools unimaginable even a decade ago. But it also diminishes perspective. Because information is so accessible and communication instantaneous, there is a diminution of focus on its significance, or even on the definition of what is significant. This dynamic may encourage policymakers to wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it, and to regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events rather than part of a historical continuum.

In both the ancient hunter-gatherer band and our intimate speech communities today, the diffusion of speech shaped values. The fact that everyone was going to be able to speak and listen had to be accommodated ethically, and it was via a rough egalitarianism. In terms of communications, people were equal and therefore it was believed they should be equal, or at least relatively so. By this code, ancient Big Men were not allowed to act controllingly and modern office managers are not allowed to silence anyone at will. Moreover, equal access to speech and hearing promoted the notion that property should be held in common, that goods and food in particular should be shared, and that everyone had a duty to take care of everyone else. This was probably more true among hunter-gatherers than it is in the modern family, circle of friends, or workplace.

Indeed, the nature claimed by many ads was associated with food products only by the ads' attachment. This is clearly a case of what French sociologist Henri Lefebvre has called ""the decline of the referentials,"" or the tendency of words under the influence of capitalism to become separated from meaningful associations. Increasingly, food ads helped shoppers become accustomed to new definitions of words such as ""fresh"" and ""natural,"" definitions that could well be considered opposite of their traditional meanings.

As far back as 32,000 years ago, prehistoric cave artists skillfully used modeling shadows to give their horses and bison volume. A few thousand years ago ancient Egyptian and then ancient Greek art presented human forms in shadow-style silhouette. But cast shadows do not appear in Western art until about 400 BCE in Athens. It was only after shadows had become an established, if controversial, part of representation that classical writers claimed that art itself had begun with the tracing of a human shadow. Greeks and Romans were the first to make the transition from modeling shadows to cast shadows, a practice that implied a consistent light source, a fixed point of view, and an understanding of geometric projection. In fact, what we might now call ""shadow studies"" — the exploration of shadows in their various artistic representations — has its roots in ancient Athens. Ever since, the practice of portraying shadows has evolved along with critical analysis of them, as artists and theoreticians have engaged in an ongoing debate about the significance of shadow representation.",The Journey of Shadows in Art from Prehistoric Caves Onward,Portrayals of Human Shadows from the Artistic Perspective,Representing Shadows as a Key Part of Contemporary Art,What Are the Primary Challenges for Shadow Painters?,Unique Views on Shadows: From Cave Artists to Romans,1

What makes practicing retrieval so much better than review? One answer comes from the psychologist R. A. Bjork's concept of desirable difficulty. More difficult retrieval leads to better learning, provided the act of retrieval is itself successful. Free recall tests, in which students need to recall as much as they can remember without prompting, tend to result in better retention than cued recall tests, in which students ② give hints about what they need to remember. Cued recall tests, in turn, are better than recognition tests, such as multiple-choice answers, ③ where the correct answer needs to be recognized but not generated. Giving someone a test immediately after they learn something improves retention less than giving them a slight delay, long enough so that answers aren't in mind when they need ④ them.

Internalization depends on supports for autonomy. Contexts that use controlling strategies such as salient rewards and punishments or evaluative, selfesteem-hooking pressures are ①least likely to lead people to value activities as their own. This is not to say that controls don't work to produce behavior - decades of operant psychology prove that they can. It is rather that the more salient the external control over a person's behavior, the more the person is likely to be merely externally regulated or introjected in his or her actions. Consequently, the person does not ③ develop a value or investment in the behaviors, but instead remains dependent on external controls. Thus, parents who reward, force, or cajole their child to do homework are more likely to have a child who does so only when rewarded, cajoled, or forced.

Alternatively, parents who supply reasons, show an emotional understanding of difficulties overcoming problems, and use a ⑤ minimum of external incentives are more likely to cultivate a sense of willingness and value for work in their child.",①,②,③,④,⑤,4

Environmental taxes based directly on measured emissions can, in principle, be very precisely targeted to the policy's environmental objectives.

(2) The polluter thus has an incentive to reduce emissions in any manner that is less costly per unit of abatement than the tax on each unit of residual emissions.

The potential contribution of greater economic success, if it involves vulnerable groups, cannot be denied.

If we understand critical thinking as: 'the identification and evaluation of evidence to guide decision-making', then ethical thinking is about identifying ethical issues and evaluating these issues from different perspectives to guide how to respond. This form of ethics is distinct from higher levels of conceptual ethics or theory. The nature of an ethical issue or problem from this perspective is that there is no clear right or wrong response. It is therefore (a) essential that students learn to think through ethical issues rather than follow a prescribed set of ethical codes or rules. There is a need to (b) encourage recognition that, although being ethical is defined as acting 'in accordance with the principles of conduct that are considered correct', these principles vary both between and within individuals. What a person (c) values relates to their social, religious, or civic beliefs influenced by their formal and informal learning experiences. Individual perspectives may also be context (d) dependent, meaning that under different circumstances, at a different time, when they are feeling a different way, the same individual may make different choices. Therefore, in order to analyse ethical issues and think ethically it is necessary to understand the personal factors that influence your own 'code of behaviour' and how these may (e) coincide, alongside recognizing and accepting that the factors that drive other people's codes and decision making may be different.

I sometimes travel to Summerland to visit friends. One of the first landmarks to captivate me there years ago was the Mackenzie-Brown House. Last week, I visited again after a long time away, and I was shocked at the state of the house - yard overgrown and stains on the beautiful walls. I am particularly sensitive to historic sites falling into disrepair. I certainly can't understand why you have neglected such a landmark, and I ask that you please restore the Mackenzie-Brown House.

Karim was deep within the dense forest alone. He began to notice the strangeness of his surroundings. Scared, he hid under a tree, and he heard the “thump-thump” sound. Moments later, he saw a large elephant running toward him! He trembled uncontrollably and could hardly move. Suddenly, he remembered what he had read about elephants: Elephants are scared of loud noises. He also thought of the firecrackers in his pack. Quick as a flash, he lit them. The firecrackers burst with a loud noise, scaring away the elephant. Then, Karim ran away as fast as he could. By the time he reached his campsite, he was sure there was nothing dangerous around him. He could finally breathe easily. He put his hand on his chest, feeling his heartbeat slow back to its normal pace.

We try to avoid uncertainty by overanalyzing. But we don't have complete control over how the future will play out. You may feel that if you can just answer your “worry question” once and for all, you will be satisfied and you can finally drop your rumination, but has this ever actually happened to you? Has there ever been an answer that allowed you to stop worrying? There is only one way out of this spiral, and that is not to try to gain control, but to give it up. Instead of pushing back against uncertainty, embrace it. Instead of trying to answer your worry question, deliberately practice leaving it unanswered. Don't ask others and don't think about it.

Journalists love to report studies that are at the “initial findings” stages—research that claims to be the first time anyone has discovered a thing—because there is newsworthiness in their novelty. But “first ever” discoveries are extremely vulnerable to becoming undermined by subsequent research. When that happens, the news media often don’t go back and inform their audiences about the change—assuming they even hear about it. Kelly Crowe, a CBC News reporter writes, quoting one epidemiologist, “There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims.” She goes on to suggest that journalists, though blameworthy for this tendency, are aided and abetted by the scientists whose studies they cite. She writes that the “conclusions” sections in scientific abstracts can sometimes be overstated in an attempt to draw attention from prestigious academic journals and media who uncritically take their bait. Even so, Crowe ends her piece by stressing that there is still an incompatibility between the purposes and processes of news and science: Science ‘evolves,’ but news ‘happens.’

By the start of the 16th century, the Renaissance movement had given birth to the Protestant Reformation and an era of profound religious change. The art of this period reflected the disruption caused by this shift. Appropriately named the Baroque, meaning irregular or distorted, European painting in the 16th century largely focused on capturing motion, drama, action, and powerful emotion. Painters employed the strong visual tools of dramatic composition, intense contrast of light and dark, and emotionally provocative subject matter to stir up feelings of disruption. Religious subjects were often portrayed in this era through new dramatic visual language, a contrast to the reverential portrayal of religious figures in earlier traditions. In order to capture the social disruption surrounding Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church, many artists abandoned old standards of visual perfection from the Classical and Renaissance periods in their portrayal of religious figures.

Chimpanzees are known to hunt and eat red colobus monkeys. Although a solo male typically initiates a hunt, others often join in, and hunting success is much higher when chimps hunt as a group rather than individually. During the hunt, chimpanzees adopt different roles: one male might flush the monkeys from their refuge, while another blocks the escape route. Somewhere else, an ambusher hides, ready to make his deadly move. Although this sounds a lot like teamwork, recent work offers a simpler interpretation. Chimps are more likely to join others for hunts because larger hunting groups increase each individual’s chance of catching a monkey—they aren’t interested in collective goals. The appearance of specialised roles in the hunt may also be an illusion: a simpler explanation is that each chimp places himself where his own chance of catching a monkey is highest, relative to the positions the others have already taken. Collaboration in chimps seems to emerge from an ‘every chimp for himself’ mentality.

Not only was Eurasia by chance blessed with biological abundance, but the very _________ of the continent greatly promoted the spread of crops between distant regions. When the supercontinent Pangea fragmented, it was torn apart along rifts that just so happened to leave Eurasia as a broad landmass running in an east-west direction - the entire continent stretches more than a third of the way around the world, but mostly within a relatively narrow range of latitudes. As it is the latitude on the Earth that largely determines the climate and length of the growing season, crops domesticated in one part of Eurasia can be transplanted across the continent with only minimal need for adaptation to the new locale. Thus wheat cultivation spread readily from the uplands of Turkey throughout Mesopotamia, to Europe, and all the way round to India, for example. The twin continents of the Americas, by contrast, lie in a north-south direction. Here, the spreading of crops originally domesticated in one region to another led to a much harder process of re-adapting the plant species to different growing conditions. [3점]

As the historian of technology Lewis Mumford argued, “the clock, not the steam engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age.” Soon factory workers were clocking in, filling out timesheets, and being punished for lateness. With time sliced into smaller and smaller periods, business owners could measure the speed of their workers down to the second, and gradually increase the pace of the production line. Workers who tried to reject this strict control by “going slow” were swiftly fired. The cruel power of the clock fed the growing culture of utilitarian efficiency, so brilliantly depicted by Charles Dickens in his 1854 novel Hard Times, where the office of Mr. Gradgrind contained “a deadly statistical clock in it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin-lid.”

Imagine some mutation appears which makes animals spontaneously die at the age of 50. This is unambiguously disadvantageous - but only very slightly so. More than 99 per cent of animals carrying this mutation will never experience its ill effects because they will die before it has a chance to act. This means that it’s pretty likely to remain in the population—not because it’s good, but because the ‘force of natural selection’ at such advanced ages is not strong enough to get rid of it. Conversely, if a mutation killed the animals at two years, striking them down when many could reasonably expect to still be alive and producing children, evolution would get rid of it very promptly: animals with the mutation would soon be outcompeted by those fortunate enough not to have it, because the force of natural selection is powerful in the years up to and including reproductive age.

A city where various people gather in various industries is secure against social changes. The same is true in the natural world, and the importance of biodiversity is essential for the sustainability of the species.
(B) This is because ensuring productivity and diversity is the driving force for sustainability. For example, if there is a place to work, people gather and work there, and the population gradually accumulates to form a city. However, the industrial structure that depends on a single industry is vulnerable to social changes.

Both ancient farmers and foragers suffered seasonal food shortages. During these periods children and adults alike would go to bed hungry some days and everyone would lose fat and muscle.
(A) Typically, in complex ecosystems when weather one year proves unsuitable for one set of plant species, it almost inevitably suits others. But in farming societies when harvests fail as a result of, for example, a sustained drought, then catastrophe emerges.
(B) This is firstly because foragers tended to live well within the natural limits imposed by their environments, and secondly because where farmers typically relied on one or two staple crops, foragers in even the harshest environments relied on dozens of different food sources and so were usually able to adjust their diets to align with an ecosystem’s own dynamic responses to changing conditions.
(C) But over longer periods of time farming societies were far more likely to suffer severe, existentially threatening famines than foragers. Foraging may be much less productive and generate far lower energy yields than farming but it is also much less risky.

By a fortunate coincidence, elements and materials that we use in large amounts need less natural concentration than those that we use in small amounts.
Ore deposits represent work that nature does for us. (1) For instance, Earth’s crust contains an average of about 55 ppm (parts per million) of copper, whereas copper ore deposits must contain about 5,000 ppm (0.5%) copper before we can mine them. (2) Thus, geologic processes need to concentrate the average copper content of the crust by about 100 times to make a copper ore deposit that we can use. (③) We then use industrial processes to convert copper ore into pure copper metal, an increase of about 200 times. (④) Thus, we are likely to have larger deposits of mineral commodities that we use in large amounts. (⑤) As long as energy costs remain high, the relation between work that we can afford to do and work that we expect nature to do will control the lower limit of natural concentrations that we can exploit, and this puts very real limits on our global mineral resources.

Martin Grunwald, leader of the Haptic Research Laboratory at the University of Leipzig, feels psychologists do not pay nearly enough attention to our sense of touch. With this in mind, he researched the way people spontaneously touch their faces. We all do it. You might be doing it right now while reading this. These movements are not for communication and, in most cases, we are not even aware of them. But that does not mean they serve no purpose, as Grunwald discovered. He measured the brain activity of test subjects while they tried to remember a sequence of haptic stimuli for five minutes. When he disturbed them with unpleasant noises, the subjects dramatically increased the rate at which they touched their faces. When the noises upset the rhythm of their brains and threatened to disrupt the subjects’ concentration, self-touch helped them get their concentration back on track. To put it another way: self-touch grounded their minds.

Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and zoologist John Krebs, in a now classic 1978 paper, point out that deceptive signaling is, itself, an evolutionary adaptation, a trait that developed in our earliest animal ancestors, to gain survival and reproductive benefits. (Think about how hostile mammalian and avian vocalizations are built upon size bluffing through lowered pitch and noisy growling—a “dishonest signal.”) According to Dawkins and Krebs, such false signaling is (a) found in all animal communication: the colors flashed by butterflies, the calls of crickets, the pheromones released by moths and ants, the body postures of lizards, and our acoustic signals. Nature is deceitful. Creatures will do what they can to not die—at least until they’ve (b) succeeded in winning a mate and passing along their genes.
But at the same time, Dawkins and Krebs tell us, the receivers of deceptive signals undergo their own coevolutionary “selection pressure” for detecting false communications.

(A) A man named James was well known for his laziness and barely made a living even with others’ help. One day, he accidentally broke his right arm and went into a restaurant, asking for a free meal. The owner of the restaurant felt pity for (a) his injury and offered him a free meal. The next day, James came back again and asked him for another free meal.
(B) James looked at the owner of the restaurant suspiciously. But moments later, James started moving bricks with his left hand. It took (b) him two hours to move all the bricks. After that, the owner offered him a meal. James felt that the meal tasted much better than the one (c) he had before. When he finished his meal, the owner handed him $50.

Scattered attention harms your ability to let go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the stressful parts of your experience.

You can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened focus turns down the stress level because you're better able to put each situation into a broader perspective.

---Managers of natural resources typically face market incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But the economic benefits provided by these services, based on their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare than the market benefits.

---The concept of overtourism rests on a particular assumption about people and places common in tourism studies and the social sciences in general. Both are seen as clearly defined and demarcated. People are framed as bounded social actors either playing the role of hosts or guests. Places, in a similar way, are treated as stable containers with clear boundaries. Hence, places can be full of tourists and thus suffer from overtourism. But what does it mean for a place to be full of people? Indeed, there are examples of particular attractions that have limited capacity and where there is actually no room for more visitors. This is not least the case with some man-made constructions such as the Eiffel Tower. However, with places such as cities, regions or even whole countries being promoted as destinations and described as victims of overtourism, things become more complex.

---Even those with average talent can produce notable work in the various sciences, so long as they do not try to embrace all of them at once. Instead, they should concentrate attention on one subject after another (that is, in different periods of time), although later work will weaken earlier attainments in the other spheres. This amounts to saying that the brain adapts to universal science in time but not in space. In fact, even those with great abilities proceed in this way. Thus, when we are astonished by someone with publications in different scientific fields, realize that each topic was explored during a specific period of time. Knowledge gained earlier certainly will not have disappeared from the mind of the author, but it will have become simplified by condensing into formulas or greatly abbreviated symbols.

--- I got married in the middle of a small wood outside of Cambridge during the summer of 2019; the night before my wedding, it started to pour with rain. At two o’clock in the morning, the rain sounded like a biblical tempest. I moved myself into the spare bedroom and spent the night awake, sick to my stomach with anxiety, and imagining the tables, chairs, hay bales and sofas we had set out in the woods that day getting soaked through, and my family and in-laws covered in mud. But in the woods at noon the next day, there was no sign of the storm. Sunlight floated through the leaves and landed on the heads of family members I thought for years might never attend my wedding. I looked over at my wife, and then for the next ten hours felt overjoyed up until the moment I went to sleep.

--- The idea of cutting out a budget category probably makes you nervous. But being mindful about your spending doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing game. Instead of forcing yourself to go entirely without, reduce spending on that category by just 10 percent each month. You won't see sudden, drastic change in your budget, but the shift will be a lot easier to stomach. Say you spent $148 at coffee shops last month. The idea of never buying coffee is enough to make you want to hide from your budget forever, but what if you challenged yourself to spend just 10 percent less on coffee this month? That's $14.80 less, for a total of $133.20. Then, next month, see if you can bring that expense down by 10 percent again to $119.88. By introducing incremental shifts instead of huge, radical changes, you're more likely to stick with your new, moderately reduced habits.",불필요한 소비를 막으려면 주기적으로 지출 내역을 확인하라.,예산 절감을 지속하기 위해 지출을 점진적으로 줄여라.,소비를 계획하기 전에 수입과 지출 현황을 분석하라.,재정 위기가 닥쳤을 때 큰 폭으로 예산을 삭감하라.,예산 항목에 따라 지출 계획을 다르게 수립하라.,2

--- Media coverage of sports is, by its very nature, ephemeral. The temporary loss of the here and now is embraced when we consume mediated sports coverage as a welcome break from the press of everyday demands. Yet, many sports fans recognize that contests that once seemed both urgent and critical often melt into the background in a week's time and are summarily forgotten. The ubiquity of sports contests and the blur of discussions about them across the contemporary mediascape contribute to this liquidity; a new ""big game"" is seemingly always around the corner and newly-fueled anticipation routinely supersedes reflection about results that have quickly faded in our memories and become trivial in the records of sports. However, rising above ubiquitous sporting competitions that quickly fade as cultural amnesia are those holding promise to become ground-breaking moments in lived experience and common culture. These are the events and championships that define a sport, solidifying one's fanship, and serving as historical markers that bring order, meaning, and significance to the sports landscape.

--- Making your marketing fun for customers is what makes them tell other people about you. This is the basis of viral marketing – the word of mouth that ultimately generates more business than all the advertising campaigns put together. Humor is good, but something that encourages customers to pass on messages to friends, business colleagues, family, and indeed anyone else will result in stronger customers’ perception of your brand and increased awareness of what your company is all about. The message need not be too serious, either, or indeed be an overt marketing plug. Just passing the brand name along, and having it associated with something entertaining and fun, is quite sufficient. Your other marketing promotions will fill in the gaps, and anyway no single promotion will ever cover all the communication you want it to – the best you can hope for is that one communication will sensitize the customers to receiving a later one.",즐거움을 주는 마케팅은 입소문을 통해 브랜드와 기업에 대한 인식을 향상시킨다.,경쟁사의 마케팅 전략을 분석하는 것은 기업 경쟁력 강화에 도움이 된다.,브랜드 이미지 제고를 위해 일관된 메시지를 전달하는 것이 중요하다.,고객의 피드백을 충실히 반영하여 제품의 질을 개선할 필요가 있다.,유머에 의존한 마케팅은 브랜드 이미지를 손상시킬 위험이 있다.,1

--- The prevalence of diseases among wild animals can be compared to an iceberg. It is only its top that appears visible to us, an insignificant fraction of its total volume. There are two main causes that converge to bring about this scenario. First, until very recently, research on wild animal disease has been an underestimated field of inquiry. Wild animal disease is thought to be relevant only inasmuch as it proves instrumental in bettering our knowledge about treatment of diseases affecting human and domestic populations. Second, disease is a fundamentally surreptitious phenomenon, often resulting from many factors interacting simultaneously. Unlike humans and other animals under human control, wild animals are anonymous. We can make estimations about their numbers and whereabouts, but we do not have accurate records of them. In addition, sick and dead animals are quickly assimilated into the environment by predators and scavengers. As a consequence, the results of wild animal death caused by disease remain, for the most part, hidden from us.

--- What sets off literary works from other narrative display texts is that they have undergone a process of selection: they have been published, reviewed, and reprinted, so that readers approach them with the assurance that others have found them well constructed and 'worth it'. So for literary works, the cooperative principle is 'hyper-protected'. We can put up with many obscurities and apparent irrelevancies, without assuming that this makes no sense. Readers assume that in literature complications of language ultimately have a communicative purpose and, instead of imagining that the speaker or writer is being uncooperative, as they might in other speech contexts, they struggle to interpret elements that flout principles of efficient communication in the interests of some further communicative goal. 'Literature' is an institutional label that gives us reason to expect that the results of our reading efforts will be 'worth it'. And many of the features of literature follow from the willingness of readers to pay attention, to explore uncertainties, and not immediately ask 'what do you mean by that?'

--- The ""rosy view"" phenomenon tells us that tourists overestimate the happiness experienced during vacations. The actual experience is perceived less enjoyable than anticipated experience and recollected experience. Some researchers further analyzed future vacation choice by investigating how the anticipated, on-line (i.e., during vacation), and remembered vacation experience in terms of emotions, predicted the desire to take a similar vacation in the future. They found that not on-line or predicted experience, but remembered experience predicted the desire to repeat the vacation. Thus, a rosy memory – accurate or not – is a major determinant for future plans for vacation travel.

This development coincided with a rejection of many traditional notions of art: that it was the work of the hand, that each work was a unique creation. ① Prices remained modest, but collectors began to emerge, and finally, in the 1970s, a true art market was established, with control over the originality and rarity of the works (limited-edition prints), expositions, galleries, and museums. ② The most valuable prints are those where the negatives are lost for this reason, some contemporary photographers destroy their negatives after making a predetermined number of prints. ③ Where negatives remain available and unlimited prints could, in principle, be made, the market distinguishes between recent and ""vintage"" prints. ④ The early 1990s saw a renewed interest in photorealism, thanks to new technology in the form of cameras and digital equipment which offered more precision. ⑤ Such a market requires experts who are able to look at a print and distinguish which year it was made from the negative.

--- The speed at which we form language can carry almost as much meaning as the words we say. Silence is not neutral or meaningless. If a job applicant hesitates too long before responding to a difficult question in a job interview, for example, we may think the applicant is at a loss for words because of being (a) unprepared. We might interpret an awkward silence following a confession of love as indication that the addressee does not feel the same way. Other non-verbal cues may help inform our interpretation of these silences. This is also a factor when we communicate online or via text. Most modern messaging services and apps tell us when a message has been read by its recipient, and so an uneasy type of silence can (b) arise when we know the recipient has read our message but, for whatever reason, has not responded. This is often referred to as leaving somebody 'on read' and is generally considered rude in online communication. Compared to face-to-face silences, where one can still read the other person's expressions or body language, these online silences feel (c) acceptable and can be even more hurtful if sensitive or difficult topics are involved.

Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy-wide experiments of any kind.

Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists - the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin).

When you break up with a partner or close friend, the natural response (after having a good cry, obviously) is to blame yourself. You wonder what you did wrong and what you might have done differently. Bonds can help us reach a more balanced perspective; there are some bonds that were simply never meant to last, even if they played an essential role in your evolution to this point. Perhaps the most valuable thing is to know that seeing bonds break doesn't have to break us. In chemistry, by definition, a change in the atomic bonding is not just the end of one state, but the beginning of another: creating the space for new bonding potential. The same is true for us as humans. It might take a cup of warm milk to reset us and give us comfort after a relationship has broken down.

In a live jazz concert a bass player can provide the audience with a ten-minute jam session but is ① unable to do so if making a record. Time and space limits on early discs made this liberalized performance style impossible. Often, pieces would be separated into a number of discs leading to a lack of continuity.

Especially in the early days of recording, human voices as well as instruments were often distorted once recorded.

Even before Marcus's time, Seneca was well aware that there was a lot of borrowing and overlap among the philosophers.

But when students were given ""worked-examples"" (such as pre-solved problems) placed between problems to solve, studying the worked-examples freed up cognitive resources that allowed students to see the key features of the problem and to analyze the steps and reasons behind problem-solving moves.
How can we help students manage cognitive load as they learn to perform complex tasks? One method that has proved effective in research studies is to support some aspects of a complex task while students perform the entire task. ( ① ) For example, Sweller and Cooper demonstrated this with students learning to solve problems in a variety of quantitative fields from statistics to physics. ( ② ) They found that when students were given typical word problems, it was possible for them to solve the problems without actually learning much.

Utilitarian ethics argues that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest total amount of happiness for the largest number of people.

Music has no past; it exists only at the moment when it happens, and no two performances are identical. This is music's greatest asset because it brings out the essential 'now' without implications of a past and a potential future. Thus, Stravinsky pointed out that only through music are we able to 'realize the present.' Musical 'meaning' cannot be separated from the act of presentation. However, the necessity of present-ing music-making it present here and now, without which it will not be music at all - does not sit easily with a concept of education that rests mainly upon received factual knowledge and which, by tradition, uses the past to make sense of the present. If we want music to have a role in general education, it would seem logical to acknowledge this difference and give prominence to activities that will involve all pupils working directly with music. Yet, in spite of numerous attempts to develop a more musical music curriculum for the majority of school pupils, the emphasis is still on pupils absorbing factual information about music.

The reality of success in the social web for businesses is that creating a social media program begins not with insight into the latest social media tools and channels but with a thorough understanding of the organization's own goals and objectives. A social media program is not merely the fulfillment of a vague need to manage a ""presence"" on popular social networks because ""everyone else is doing it."" ""Being in social media"" serves no purpose in and of itself.

--- Environmental hazards include biological, physical, and chemical ones, along with the human behaviors that promote or allow exposure. Some environmental contaminants are difficult to avoid (the breathing of polluted air, the drinking of chemically contaminated public drinking water, noise in open public spaces); in these circumstances, exposure is largely involuntary. Reduction or elimination of these factors may require societal action, such as public awareness and public health measures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental hazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be more morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided.

--- Scientists use paradigms rather than believing them. The use of a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems by employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions, experimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even some of the same theoretical statements. Scientists need only understand how to use these various elements in ways that others would accept. These elements of shared practice thus need not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists' beliefs about what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role of a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully without having to provide a detailed account of what they are doing or what they believe about it. Thomas Kuhn noted that scientists ""can agree in their identification of a paradigm without agreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full interpretation or rationalization of it.

--- Mending and restoring objects often require even more creativity than original production. The preindustrial blacksmith made things to order for people in his immediate community; customizing the product, modifying or transforming it according to the user, was routine. Customers would bring things back if something went wrong; repair was thus an extension of fabrication. With industrialization and eventually with mass production, making things became the province of machine tenders with limited knowledge. But repair continued to require a larger grasp of design and materials, an understanding of the whole and a comprehension of the designer's intentions. ""Manufacturers all work by machinery or by vast subdivision of labour and not, so to speak, by hand,"" an 1896 Manual of Mending and Repairing explained. ""But all repairing must be done by hand.

Large-scale adoption of ""organic"" farming methods, however, would reduce yields and increase production costs for many major crops. Inorganic nitrogen supplies are essential for maintaining moderate to high levels of productivity for many of the non-leguminous crop species, because organic supplies of nitrogenous materials often are either limited or more expensive than inorganic nitrogen fertilizers.

This is a significant insight, as it shows that prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the problem of the commons coming from a state power in comparison with a local solution for which users assume personal responsibility.

--- Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for all meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences is, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever greater precision. But historical representation puts a premium on a proliferation of representations, hence not on the refinement of one representation but on the production of an ever more varied set of representations. Historical insight is not a matter of a continuous ""narrowing down"" of previous options, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the contrary, is an ""explosion"" of possible points of view. It therefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of determinacy and precision by the production of new and alternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by a careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those previous representations. And from this perspective, the development of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the outsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous questioning of ____________ rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation to the truth.

Cinema is valuable not for its ability to make visible the hidden outlines of our reality, but for its ability to reveal what reality itself veils - the dimension of fantasy.

--- Philip Kitcher and Wesley Salmon have suggested that there are two possible alternatives among philosophical theories of explanation. One is the view that scientific explanation consists in the unification of broad bodies of phenomena under a minimal number of generalizations. According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science is to construct an economical framework of laws or generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable phenomena. Scientific explanations organize and systematize our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what is explained. The other view is the causal/mechanical approach. According to it, a scientific explanation of a phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that produced the phenomenon of interest. This view sees the explanation of individual events as primary, with the explanation of generalizations flowing from them. That is, the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities.

New ideas, such as those inspired by scientific developments, are often aired and critiqued in our popular culture as part of a healthy process of public debate, and scientists sometimes deserve the criticism they get. But the popularization of science would be greatly enhanced by improving the widespread images of the scientist. Part of the problem may be that the majority of the people who are most likely to write novels, plays, and film scripts were educated in the humanities, not in the sciences. Furthermore, the few scientists-turned-writers have used their scientific training as the source material for thrillers that further damage the image of science and scientists.

Although cognitive and neuropsychological approaches emphasize the losses with age that might impair social perception, motivational theories indicate that there may be some gains or qualitative changes. Charles and Carstensen review a considerable body of evidence indicating that, as people get older, they tend to prioritize close social relationships, focus more on achieving emotional well-being, and attend more to positive emotional information while ignoring negative information. These changing motivational goals in old age have implications for attention to and processing of social cues from the environment. Of particular importance in considering emotional changes in old age is the presence of a positivity bias: that is, a tendency to notice, attend to, and remember more positive compared to negative information. The role of life experience in social skills also indicates that older adults might show gains in some aspects of social perception.",Social Perception in Old Age: It's Not All Bad News!,Blocking Out the Negative Sharpens Social Skills,Lessons on Life-long Goals from Senior Achievers,Getting Old: A Road to Maturity and Objectivity,Positive Mind and Behavior: Tips for Reversing Aging,1

Emma Brindley has investigated the responses of European robins to the songs of neighbors and strangers. Despite the large and complex song repertoire of European robins, they were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and strangers. When they heard a tape recording of a stranger, they began to sing sooner, sang more songs, and overlapped their songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a neighbor’s song. As Brindley suggests, the overlapping of song may be an aggressive response. However, this difference in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when the neighbor’s song was played by a loudspeaker placed at the boundary between that neighbor’s territory and the territory of the bird being tested. If the same neighbor’s song was played at another boundary, one separating the territory of the test subject from another neighbor, it was treated as the call of a stranger. Not only does this result demonstrate that _______________ but it also shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments is highly important.

How is privacy protected? Historically, privacy was protected by restricting circulation of the damaging material.

Fighting against the force of the water was a thrilling challenge. Sophia tried to keep herself planted firmly in the boat, paying attention to the waves crashing against the rocks. As the water got rougher, she was forced to paddle harder to keep the waves from tossing her into the water. Her friends Mia and Rebecca were paddling eagerly behind her to balance the boat. They were soaked from all of the spray. Mia shouted to Sophia, “Are you OK? Aren’t (a) you scared?”
(B)
“You’ve got a good point. It’s a real advantage to graduate from college with the mindset of a daring adventurer,” Mia said. Rebecca quickly added, “That’s why I went to Mongolia before I started my first job out of college. Teaching English there for two months was a big challenge for me.

“I’m great!” Sophia shouted back excitedly. Even though the boat was getting thrown around, the girls managed to avoid hitting any rocks. Suddenly, almost as quickly as the water had got rougher, the river seemed to calm down, and they all felt relaxed. With a sigh of relief, Sophia looked around. “Wow! What a wonderful view!” (d) she shouted. The scenery around them was breathtaking. Everyone was speechless. As they enjoyed the emerald green Rocky Mountains, Mia said, “No wonder rafting is the best thing to do in Colorado!”

Agreeing with her friend, Rebecca gave a thumbs-up. “Sophia, your choice was excellent!” she said with a delighted smile. “I thought you were afraid of water, though, Sophia,” Mia said. Sophia explained, “Well, I was before I started rafting. But I graduate from college in a few months. And, before I do, I wanted to do something really adventurous to test my bravery.

Skills-based approaches to teaching critical thinking now have a long history and literature, but what has become clear through more than 25 years of work on critical thinking theory and pedagogy is that teaching students a set of thinking skills does not seem to be enough. Students may learn to write an adequate article critique in one class, but fail to use those skills in another. They may learn how to evaluate research methodology in other students' research designs, but completely miss the flaws in their own. They may learn to recognize thinking biases in the classroom, but still use badly flawed reasoning in their own decision making. Too often students think our courses are either about memorizing a great deal of material, or about learning the rules for and playing one more idiosyncratic academic game.

As much as we like to think of ourselves as being different and special, humans are a part of Earth's biosphere, created within and by it. Ultimately, it is the living, breathing elements of this world that we need more than inanimate supplies, such as coal, gas, or bauxite ore. We can live without cars or beer cans, but we cannot without food and oxygen. As nations around the globe try to band together to attack the problems of greenhouse gas emissions and the shrinking availability of fresh drinking water, in all corners of the world thousands of species quietly go extinct. E. O. Wilson, the renowned Harvard biologist, recently presented the problem our species faces in a succinct law: ""If you save the living environment, the biodiversity that we have left, you will also automatically save the physical environment, too.

We don't know what ancient Greek music sounded like, because there are no examples of it in written or notated form, nor has it survived in oral tradition. Much of it was probably improvised anyway, within certain rules and conventions. So we are forced largely to guess at its basis from the accounts of writers such as Plato and Aristotle, who were generally more concerned with writing about music as a philosophical and ethical exercise as with providing a technical primer on its practice. It seems Greek music was predominantly a vocal form, consisting of sung verse accompanied by instruments such as the lyre or the plucked kithara (the root of 'guitar'). In fact, Plato considered music in which the lyre and flute played alone and not as the accompaniment of dance or song to be 'exceedingly coarse and tasteless'. The melodies seem to have had a very limited pitch range, since the instruments generally span only an octave, from one E (as we'd now define it) to the next.",①,②,③,④,⑤,2

Just as there's a tendency to glorify technological progress, there's a countertendency to expect the worst of every new tool or machine.

He feared that, as people came to rely on the written word as a substitute for the knowledge they used to carry inside their heads, they would, in the words of one of the dialogue's characters, ""cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful.""

In the Indian language of pali, mettā means benevolence, kindness or tenderness. It is one of the most important ideas in Buddhism. Buddhism recommends a daily ritual meditation (known as mettā bhāvanā) to foster this attitude. The meditation begins with a call to think carefully every morning of an individual with whom one tends to get irritated or to whom one feels aggressive or cold and-in place of one's normal hostile impulses - to rehearse kindly messages like 'I hope you will find peace' or 'I wish you to be free from suffering'.

Necho II reportedly ordered a Phoenician expedition to sail clockwise around Africa, starting at the Red Sea and returning to the mouth of the Nile. They were gone for three years. Herodotus writes that the Phoenicians, upon returning from their heroic expedition, reported that after sailing south and then turning west, they found the sun was on their right, the opposite direction to where they were used to seeing it or expecting it to be.

When approaching practical music making for the first time in the classroom, it is a good idea to avoid using instruments altogether. ① This will allow an inexperienced teacher to focus on the development of fundamental musical behaviour through listening, performing and composing; and allow the children to focus on the more controllable sound sources i.e. voices and body percussion (clapping, clicking, stamping etc). ② Music starts with these both developmentally and historically: the most expressive and immediate musical instrument is the human voice. ③ The sound quality of an instrument is a direct result of the quality of the materials, design, and making. ④ Body movements are not only an instinctive response to music but also instigate music making. ⑤ Activities which develop many of the coordination skills, aural sensitivity, responses to visual cues and symbols, and the musical understanding necessary to play an instrument can all be established without instruments.",①,②,③,④,⑤,3

Why would languages and religions increase rapidly around the equator, and why is their frequency also related to ethnocentrism? The answer to these questions lies in the fact that pathogen density is much higher in the tropics than it is in temperate and cold climates. When you live in Sweden, chances are good that any group within five hundred miles has been exposed to the same few pathogens. In contrast, when you live in the Congo, the group on the other side of the valley may well have been exposed to a pathogen with which you've had no prior contact. For this reason, humans in the tropics learned that when they interacted with other groups they tended to get sick, so they would have stopped doing it. In a pre-scientific world, it was logical to blame their neighbors for their illness, and therefore to dislike them. Dislike and fear kept neighbors apart, and once you don't interact with others anymore, your languages and religions naturally divide as well.

I'm well aware that in this difficult economy, organisations such as the Wakefield Community Theatre are facing financial difficulties and therefore an increase in ticket prices is inevitable. But in my opinion, a 50 percent increase to the price of individual tickets seems totally unreasonable. It would mean that ordinary residents like myself will have fewer opportunities to enjoy a quality drama performance. Pricing tickets out of the range of local residents is not a good option, because it'll hurt your organisation in years to come.

--- Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of innovation is how unpopular it is, for all the lip service we pay to it. Despite the abundant evidence that it has transformed almost everybody's lives for the better in innumerable ways, the kneejerk reaction of most people to something new is often worry, sometimes even disgust. Unless it is of obvious use to ourselves, we tend to imagine the bad consequences that might occur far more than the good ones.

--- The immense improvement in the yield of farming during the twentieth century, as a result of innovations in mechanization, fertilizer, new varieties, pesticides and genetic engineering, has banished famine from the face of the planet almost entirely, and drastically reduced malnutrition, even while the human population has continued to expand. Few predicted this, yet many are concerned that this improvement has come at the expense of nature. In fact the evidence is strong that the opposite is the case. Innovation in food production has spared land and forest from the plough, the cow and the axe on a grand scale by increasing the productivity of the land we do farm. It turns out that this 'land sparing' has been much better for biodiversity than land sharing would have been - by which is meant growing crops at low yields in the hope that abundant wildlife lives in fields alongside crops.",친환경 농법이 자연에 해로운 경우도 있다.,식량 생산 증가가 인구 증가로 이어지지는 않는다.,생물 다양성이 높아지면서 생태계의 생산성도 높아졌다.,대규모 경작보다 소규모 경작이 농업 생산성에 유리하다.,농업 혁신이 식량 생산량을 늘리면서도 자연 훼손을 억제했다.,5

--- More recently there have been attempts to argue that unpaid work is work because 'it is an activity that combines labour with raw materials to produce goods and services with enhanced economic value'. Economists such as Duncan Ironmonger have attempted to impute a dollar value on volunteering to enable its 'economic' value to be counted. Yet despite this, unpaid work and volunteering still remain outside the defined economic framework of our capitalist system because capitalism has competition and financial reward as its cornerstones and volunteering does not. Having said that, it has been estimated that volunteering contributes about $42 billion a year to the Australian economy. Although attempts to quantify and qualify the financial importance of volunteering in supporting our economic structures and enhancing our social capital continue to be made, it is slow going. And while volunteering remains outside the GDP, its true value and importance is neglected.

After a series of animal trials, in 1892 he tested the cholera vaccine on himself, risking his own life. During the Indian cholera epidemic of 1893, at the invitation of the Government of India he went to Calcutta and introduced his vaccine. After initial criticism by the local medical bodies, it was widely accepted. Haffkine was appointed as the director of the Plague Laboratory in Bombay (now called the Haffkine Institute). After his retirement in 1914, he returned to France and occasionally wrote for medical journals.

--- A basic principle in economics is that when the supply of something goes up, its price should go down. The puzzle was that in the twentieth century, there were prolonged periods where the reverse appeared to happen in the world of work. In some countries, there was huge growth in the number of high-skilled people pouring out of colleges and universities, yet their wages appeared to rise rather than fall compared to those without this education. How could this be? The supply of high-skilled workers did grow, pushing their wages downward, but new technologies were skill-biased and so caused the demand for high-skilled workers to soar. The latter effect was so great that it overcame the former, so even though there were more educated people looking for work, the demand for them was so strong that the amount they were paid still went up.

Our ability to respond to danger has been important for
survival, so feeling worried in uncertain situations is normal.
Feelings of worry, which are activated in anticipation of future
events, are often experienced in everyday situations. For
example, we may feel nervous imagining unlikely events, such
as a computer crashing during an important presentation. To
some extent, thinking through potential scenarios can be
helpful. When our worries exceed our control, however, they
cause us unnecessary suffering. Consider how many times you
have lost sleep thinking about a terrible situation, which, in the

Information and meaning are, clearly, not the same thing.
The former refers to uninterpreted data or sensory states whose
probability in a certain situation can be easily measured; the
latter refers to the interpretation of the data or sensory states,
including the special kinds of nuances and values that the
information entails, or is intended to have, in the given situation.
This applies to any type of information, from alarm signals to
sophisticated statements. Take, for instance, a coin-tossing
game in which it is decided that throwing three heads in a row
constitutes a win. If a certain player ends up consistently with
the desired outcome, defeating all who challenge that player,
then we tend to interpret the outcome either as the work of

of the winning player. Interpretation is the core of everything

The purpose of class discussions is to encourage you to be
an active participant, not a passive recorder. Much of the
emphasis in a discussion is on getting students involved in
thinking, reacting, and responding. These are important
intellectual activities in the learning process, for through them
you are supposed to discover and express your opinions.
Writing is an invaluable tool for accomplishing these tasks.
Unfortunately, too many times, when class discussion begins,
pens and pencils go down. Admittedly, it is considerably more
difficult to take notes from discussions than from lectures, for,
unlike lectures, discussions tend to be disorganized and difficult
to follow. Also, students usually don't know how much of
what other students are saying is important. And if you are an
active participant, it is not easy to take notes and formulate
what you want to say. But note taking in discussions is not
only manageable, it is also important. Note taking helps to keep

Food, as we all know, is essential for human life. It also is
the basis for several major industries found in many countries
around the world such as in agriculture, food processing, food
retailing and food service. For millennia, the focus of those
involved with food as a human and economic phenomenon
was on its production, preservation, distribution, pricing and
other practical concerns. But in the late 18th century this
began to change. Food became more than just a life necessity.
Restaurants began to be developed, initially in France but
eventually in other nations, as a distinct institution offering
people dining choices and table service, the opportunity for
socialization and, over time, a finer and finer atmosphere. The
rise of restaurants eventually led to a class of diners who
prided themselves on being critics of taste, food and cooking.

and never let it go. ( ③ ) The beautiful product or package
design elicits a self-expressive, or signaling, motivation – a
desire to express oneself to others through product ownership.
(④) Certain types of cute products can be associated with a
lack of sophistication or seriousness, which can reduce
performance expectations (lowering perceived enablement
benefits). (⑤) Beautiful-looking designs may not attract
attention over time because people become desensitized to
them.

They might be sitting still as they imagine all of this walking

Researchers are studying how our everyday physical
experiences in the world contribute to our understanding of
mathematical concepts. ( ① ) The experience of walking
along a path, for example, can be a metaphor for thinking about
arithmetic. ( ② ) The path starts at some point 0 and as
children walk along, every step takes them 1 unit further from
the starting point; they can even take half steps or skip along
two steps at a time. ( ③ ) If they want to imagine what it might
mean to add 5 and 9, they could think of first walking 9 steps
and then walking 5 more. ( ④ ) But that also helps them
think about what 14-3 might mean because they can imagine
walking backwards. ( ⑤ ) If they close their eyes, they might

A serious deterioration in people's working lives would
be deeply disturbing to the social order. Indeed, few
consequences of technological change would be as
dangerous. Today, the world of work is the main way that
we share out the fruits of growth: for most people, their
job is their main, if not their only, source of income.
Technological unemployment would weaken that longstanding
arrangement, encouraging an even more extreme version
of inequality in which some people receive more income
than others and many receive nothing at all. Nor would the
disturbance be only economic. For many people, their
work is both a source of income and of meaning. And with
that in mind, the threat is even broader: not only that the
labor market might be hollowed out, leaving some unable
to find a good job and a reliable income, but that this sense
of fulfilment that some people are fortunate to feel in their
jobs might be hollowed out as well, leaving them unable to
find purpose and live a satisfying life.

In improv, the actors have no control of the conversation or the direction it takes. They can only react to the other actors' words or nonverbal communication. Because of this, the actors become experts at reading body language and reading between the lines of what is said. If they are unable to do this, they are left in the dark and the performance crumbles. This applies to our daily conversations, but we're usually too self-centered to notice. Just like the improv actors become adept at picking up on the breadcrumbs of the conversation, we need to do the same. When people want to talk about something specific, rarely will they come out and just say it. 99 percent of people won't say, ""Hey, let's talk about my dog now. So...."" Instead, they will hint at it. When they bring up a topic unprompted, or ask questions about it, they want to talk about it. Sometimes, when the other person seems to not pick up on these signals, they will keep redirecting the conversation to that specific topic. If they seem excited whenever the topic comes up, they want to talk about it.

The relevance of science in understanding organizational behavior can start with asking this question: Why do good managers make bad decisions? Too often managers make mistakes when it comes to fostering conditions that inspire positive outcomes in the workplace, such as performance, satisfaction, team cohesion, and ethical behavior. Why does this happen? Part of the reason is that rather than relying on a clearly validated set of scientific discoveries, managers use less reliable sources of insight such as gut feel, intuition, the latest trend, what a highly paid consultant might say, or what is being done in another company. Like most of us, managers tend to rely on their own strengths and experiences when making choices about how to get the best from others. But what works for one manager may not work for another.

Natural disasters and aging are two problems that societies have been dealing with for all of human history. Governments must respond to both, but their dynamics are entirely different and this has profound consequences for the nature of the response. Simply by plotting the aging slope, policy makers go a long way toward understanding the problem: People get older at a constant and reliable rate. There can be disagreements over how to solve the aging problem (this is political complexity), but the nature of the problem is never in dispute. Plotting the number of people killed in natural disasters does very little to advance understanding of this problem other than emphasizing the randomness of natural disasters. Preparing a policy response is, therefore, much easier in some areas than in others.

Citing studies in education that sought to increase resources for marginalized youths by documenting the ""illiteracies"" of indigenous youths and youths of color, Tuck explains that damage-based research is a popular mechanism by which ""pain and loss are documented in order to obtain particular political or material gains."" While damage-based studies have proven successful in attaining political or material gains in the form of funding, attention, and increased awareness related to the struggles of marginalized communities, Tuck points researchers to the ongoing violence damage-based research inflicts on marginalized communities, even under benevolent or perceivably beneficial circumstances. Among the many issues associated with damage-based research are the underlying assumptions this type of work makes and sustains about marginalized people; namely, that marginalized communities lack communication, civility, intellect, desires, assets, innovation, and ethics.

The outcomes of want-should conflicts are affected not only by what we think our future self will choose but also by how close we feel to our future self. Want-should conflicts fundamentally involve tradeoffs between options that satisfy the present self's desires (wants) and options that benefit the future self (shoulds). As a result, when we do not feel psychologically connected to our future self, we should be ① less interested in taking actions to benefit this self and thus shy away from should options. Indeed, an emerging stream of research suggests that people are more impatient the more disconnected they feel from their future self. For example, people prefer smaller-sooner rewards over larger-later rewards at a higher rate when they anticipate experiencing life-changing events (rather than events are unlikely to change their identity and beliefs), since life-changing events induce a greater ③ disassociation between their image of their present self and their image of their future self. More generally, when people are told that their identity will change considerably over time, they are more likely to ④ abandon immediate benefits (wants) and forsake larger deferred benefits (shoulds).

It has been clear for centuries that tree parents play such an important role in raising their offspring that they can be compared to human parents. A mother tree identifies which neighboring seedlings are hers using her roots. She then, via delicate connections, supports the seedlings with a solution of sugar, a process similar to a human mother nursing her child. Shade provided by parents is another form of care, as it curbs the growth of youngsters living under their crowns. Without the shade and exposed to full sunlight, the young trees would shoot up and expand the width of their trunks so quickly they'd be exhausted after just a century or two. If, however, the young trees stand strong in the shadows for decades - or even centuries - they can live to a great age. Shade means less sunlight and therefore considerably less sugar, as generations of foresters have observed. To this day, they talk of what is known in German as erzieherischer Schatten or ""instructive shade."" [3점]

In a context in which the cultural obligation to produce the self as a distinctive, authentic individual is difficult to fulfill, the burdensome work of individualizing the self is turned over increasingly to algorithms. ① The ""personalization"" that is promised on every front-in the domains of search, shopping, health, news, advertising, learning, music, and entertainment - depends on ever more refined algorithmic constructions of individuality. ② As it becomes more difficult to produce our digital selves as unique individuals, we are increasingly being produced as unique individuals from the outside. ③ When AI algorithms learn more about our identities, it becomes essential to safeguard this information and ensure that individuals have control and consent over the data collected about them. ④ Individuality is redefined from a cultural practice and reflexive project to an algorithmic process. ⑤ Our unique selfhood is no longer something for which we are wholly responsible; it is algorithmically guaranteed.",1번 문장,2번 문장,3번 문장,4번 문장,5번 문장,3

Technocracy can be thought to influence technological decision-making in one of two ways.
(A) This is because policy-makers work within the constraints set by the experts and choose from the options those experts provide. The technocratic element is clear: experts set the agenda and political judgements are parasitic on the judgements of experts.

(C) In contrast, a more moderate form in which experts advise and politicians decide is found in many democratic societies. Also called the 'decisionist model', this form of technocracy institutionalizes a division of labour based on the distinction between facts and values and allows specialist experts to wield significant power.

(B) That extra carbon is stored in living biomass like tree trunks and soil bacteria and fungi, and as carbon compounds in the soil.

Following this pathway, we act altruistically when we feel empathy for a person and can truly imagine a situation from their perspective.
Prosocial behavior - that is, behavior that is intended to help another person- can be motivated by two different pathways, according to Daniel Batson at the University of Kansas. (1) One pathway, the egoistic pathway, is largely self-focused: we provide help if the rewards to us outweigh the costs. (② ) This pathway is the one that is operating if we hand a homeless person a dollar to make ourselves feel better. ( 3 ) Doing so costs us very little-only a dollar and the reward of doing so avoiding the guilt we'd feel from simply walking by is greater. ( 4 ) But according to Batson's hypothesis, there is another pathway, which is other-focused-it's motivated by a genuine desire to help the other person, even if we incur a cost for doing so.

Our behaviour can be modified externally without there being strong personal motivation. Everything from our supermarket shopping and online browsing choices are examples of how our actions are shaped without our conscious choice or motivation. ( ① ) However, when processes police us but fail to truly influence us, we do not continue with the behaviours after the processes are removed. (2) This is passive engagement rather than ownership.

( ④ ) You may not be sold on going vegan, but yet give veganism a try at the start of the year because some of your friends suggest you do it together.

Communication is decisively influenced by how the partners define their relationship with each other at every moment of the communication process. If the communication is symmetrical, this means that both communication partners strive for equality and interact accordingly. They behave as mirror images of each other, so to speak. Strength is mirrored with strength, weakness is mirrored with weakness, or hardness is mirrored with hardness, etc. Complementary communication shows a matching difference in behaviour. It is not a matter of up and down, strong and weak, or good and bad, but of matching and expected difference. Such complementary relationships occur between teachers and students, mother and child, or managers and employees, etc. What the expectations are in such relationships depends, among other things, on the cultural background. If the expectations of complementarity are not met, communication breakdowns occur. For example, if an older person in Japan is not treated with a certain respect by a younger person, this circumstance can significantly impair communication or even make it impossible.

The point is elementary: you can't have sustainable capitalism without capital; you can't have capital without savings; and you can't save if you're running around spending everything you've just earned. But the confusion has grown so deep that many people today do not have the ears to hear it.

--- In making sense of cave art, anthropologists have turned to surviving hunter-gatherer societies that continue to paint inside caves, particularly the San peoples, who live in communities across a wide region of southern Africa. What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their detailed imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture. In the final stage of a trance, Lewis-Williams writes, 'people sometimes feel themselves to be turning into animals and undergoing other frightening or exalting transformations'. For anthropologist Kim Hill, identifying and observing animals to eat and those to escape might merge into 'a single process' that sees animals as having humanlike intentions that 'can influence and be influenced'.",Cave Paintings: The Dawn of Human Creativity,Early Humans' Communication Through Cave Art,Hardships of Early Humans Depicted in Cave Art,Shamanistic Culture for Paying Honor to Ancestors,Animal Imitation Rituals and Understanding Cave Art,5

--- The idea that leaders inherently possess certain physical, intellectual, or personality traits that distinguish them from nonleaders ① was the foundational belief of the trait-based approach to leadership. This approach dominated leadership research from the late 1800s until the mid-1940s and has experienced a resurgence of interest in the last couple of decades. Early trait theorists believed that some individuals are born with the traits that allow them to become great leaders. Thus, early research in this area often presented the widely stated argument ③ that ""leaders are born, not made."" Also, some of the earliest leadership studies were grounded in what ④ referred to as the ""great man"" theory because researchers at the time focused on identifying traits of highly visible leaders in history who were typically male and associated with the aristocracy or political or military leadership. In more recent history, numerous authors have acknowledged that there are many enduring qualities, whether innate or learned, that contribute to leadership potential. These traits include such things as drive, self-confidence, cognitive ability, conscientiousness, determination, intelligence, and integrity.",①,②,③,④,⑤,4

--- Musical performers and their labor union did not perceive early recordings as a threat to their livelihoods because the recordings were mostly of poor quality. It was not long before musicians began to wonder whether recordings of popular artists or songs would undermine the demand for live music. For a time, however, recorded music was too scratchy to pose a serious threat, even though it played in commercial places and offered a few performers a way to ②supplement their income. Additionally, during the early days of recording, radio stations ③ preferred using live musicians on their programs. Sound from live performances was better quality, and stations at this time rarely used recordings. Broadcasters ④ rejected union demands for employment and decent wages, because the alterative use of recordings was even less attractive.

Political risk, unlike credit or market or operational risk, can be unsystematic and therefore more difficult to address in classic statistical terms. What is the probability that terrorists will attack the United States again? Unlike earthquakes or hurricanes, political actors constantly adapt to overcome the barriers created by risk managers. When corporations structure foreign investments to mitigate risks of expropriations, through international guarantees or legal contracts, host governments seek out new forms of obstruction, such as creeping expropriation or regulatory discrimination, that are very hard and legally costly to prove.

--- Magical thinking, intellectual insecurity, and confirmation bias are all parallel barriers to scientific discovery; they blocked the eyes of generations of astronomers before Copernicus. But as twenty-first-century researchers have discovered, these three barriers can all be destroyed with a simple teaching trick: transporting our brain to an environment outside our own. That environment can be a nature preserve many miles from our home, or a computer-simulated Mars, or any other space that our ego doesn't associate directly with its health, social status, and material success. In that environment, our ego will be less inclined to take the failure of its predictions personally. Certainly, our ego may feel a little upset that its guesses about the nature preserve or Mars were wrong, but it was never really that invested in the guesses to begin with.

People just ""knew"" that's how horses galloped, and that is how they ""saw"" them galloping. Cavemen saw them this way, Aristotle saw them this way, and so did Victorian gentry. But all of that ended when, in 1878, Eadweard Muybridge published a set of twelve pictures he had taken of a galloping horse in the space of less than half a second using twelve cameras hooked to wire triggers. Muybridge's photos showed clearly that a horse goes completely airborne in the third step of the gallop with its legs collected beneath it, not splayed. It is called the moment of suspension.

Water molecules circulate through the atmosphere as a result of evaporation.

( ② ) Whereas the much heavier oxygen either remains in the atmosphere or is captured on the Earth's surface, the hydrogen tends to escape into space, because it is so light that Earth's gravity cannot retain it.

The man asked the kids to move over, but they ignored him. Next day, the children came again. The man called them over, gave each one a nickel, and asked them to make as much noise as they possibly could-to which they happily obliged. The man kept regularly handing out coins, until one day he told the kids that he was no longer paying them. ""Then we aren't going to make noise for you,"" the children announced - and left.

Indirect reciprocity now means something like “If I scratch your back, my good example will encourage others to do the same and, with luck, someone will scratch mine.” By the same token, our behavior is endlessly shaped by the possibility that somebody else might be watching us or might find out what we have done. We are often troubled by the thought of what others may think of our deeds. In this way, our actions have consequences that go far beyond any individual act of charity, or indeed any act of mean-spirited malice.

 --- When you experience affect without knowing the cause, you are more likely to treat affect as information about the world, rather than your experience of the world. The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. For example, people report more happiness and life satisfaction on sunny days, but only when they are not explicitly asked about the weather. When you apply for a job or college or medical school, make sure you interview on a sunny day, because interviewers tend to rate applicants more negatively when it is rainy. And the next time a good friend snaps at you, remember affective realism. Maybe your friend is irritated with you, but perhaps she didn't sleep well last night, or maybe it's just lunchtime.

It may seem odd to consider finding ways to “collect” energy that is given off all around us – by people simply walking or by walking upstairs and downstairs or by riding stationary/exercise bicycles, for example – but that is the general idea and nature of energy harvesting. The broad idea of energy harvesting is that there are many places at which small amounts of energy are generated and often wasted – and when collected, this can be put to some practical use. Current efforts have begun, aimed at collecting such energy in smaller devices which can store it, such as portable batteries.",Energy Harvesting: Every Little Helps,Burning Waste for Energy Is Harmful,Is Renewable Energy Really Green?,Pros and Cons of Energy Harvesting,Can Natural Energy Sources Fulfill the Demand?,1

 --- Georgy Gause was born in Moscow, Russia. He was admitted to Moscow State University, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1931 and PhD in 1940. Prior to achieving his doctoral degree, Gause published his ecological classic, The Struggle for Existence, in 1934 (and in English!). This book and similar research papers in the 1930s helped lay the early foundation for population ecology and indeed fostered the introduction of mathematics into the historical development of ecology. In ecology, Gause's contributions are equally acknowledged along with those of other early ecologists who studied population dynamics. However, most ecologists are not aware that Gause eventually went on to conduct very important research on antibiotics and somewhat left ecology behind.

 --- The quest for knowledge in the material world is a never-ending pursuit, but the quest does not mean that a thoroughly schooled person is an educated person or that an educated person is a wise person. We are too often blinded by our ignorance of our ignorance, and our pursuit of knowledge is no guarantee of wisdom. Hence, we are prone to becoming the blind leading the blind because our overemphasis on competition in nearly everything makes looking good more important than being good. The resultant fear of being thought a fool and criticized therefore is one of greatest enemies of true learning.

 --- Lewis-Williams believes that the religious view of hunter groups was a contract between the hunter and the hunted. 'The powers of the underworld allowed people to kill animals, provided people responded in certain ritual ways, such as taking fragments of animals into the caves and inserting them into the “membrane”.' This is borne out in the San. Like other shamanistic societies, they have admiring practices between human hunters and their prey, suffused with taboos derived from extensive natural knowledge. These practices suggest that honouring may be one method of softening the disquiet of killing. It should be said that this disquiet needn’t arise because there is something fundamentally wrong with a human killing another animal, but simply because we are aware of doing the killing. And perhaps, too, because in some sense we ‘know’ what we are killing. We make sound guesses that the pain and desire for life we feel – our worlds of experience – have a counterpart in the animal we kill. As predators, this can create problems for us.

 --- The empiricist philosopher John Locke argued that when the human being was first born, the mind was simply a blank slate – a tabula rasa – waiting to be written on by experience. Locke believed that our experience shapes who we are and who we become and therefore he also believed that, given different experiences, human beings would have different characters. The influence of these ideas was profound, particularly for the new colonies in America, for example, because these were conscious attempts to make a new start and to form a new society. The new society was to operate on a different basis from that of European culture, which was based on the feudal system in which people’s place in society was almost entirely determined by birth, and which therefore tended to emphasize innate characteristics. Locke’s emphasis on the importance of experience in forming the human being provided ___________.

 --- In A Theory of Adaptation, Linda Hutcheon argues that “An adaptation is not vampiric: it does not draw the life-blood from its source and leave it dying or dead, nor is it paler than the adapted work. It may, on the contrary, keep that prior work alive, giving it an afterlife it would never have had otherwise.” Hutcheon’s refusal to see adaptation as “vampiric” is particularly inspiring for those of us who do work on adaptations. The idea of an “afterlife” of texts, of seeing what comes before as an inspiration for what comes now, is, by its very definition, keeping works “alive.” Adaptations for young adults, in particular, have the added benefit of engaging the young adult reader with both then and now, past and present – functioning as both “monuments” to history and the “flesh” of the reader’s lived experience.

 --- According to the principle of social proof, one way individuals determine appropriate behavior for themselves in a situation is to examine the behavior of others there — especially similar others. ① It is through social comparison with these referent others that people validate the correctness of their opinions and decisions. ② Consequently, people tend to behave as their friends and peers have behaved. ③ Because the critical source of information within the principle of social proof is the responses of referent others, compliance tactics that employ this information should be especially effective in collectivistically oriented nations and persons. ④ That is, where the individualized self is both the focus and the standard, one’s own behavioral history should be heavily weighted in subsequent behavior. ⑤ Some evidence in this regard comes from a study showing that advertisements that promoted group benefits were more persuasive in Korea (a collectivistic society) than in the United States (an individualistic society).",1,2,3,4,5,4

 --- A large body of research in decision science has indicated that one attribute that is regularly substituted for an explicit assessment of decision costs and benefits is an affective valuation of the prospect at hand.
(A) People were willing to pay almost as much to avoid a 1 percent probability of receiving a shock as they were to pay to avoid a 99 percent probability of receiving a shock. Clearly the affective reaction to the thought of receiving a shock was overwhelming the subjects’ ability to evaluate the probabilities associated.
(B) This is often a very rational attribute to substitute – affect does convey useful signals as to the costs and benefits of outcomes. A problem sometimes arises, however, when affective valuation is not supplemented by any analytic processing and adjustment at all.
(C) For example, sole reliance on affective valuation can make people insensitive to probabilities and to quantitative features of the outcome that should effect decisions.

 --- However, human reasoning is still notoriously prone to confusion and error when causal questions become sufficiently complex, such as when it comes to assessing the impact of policy interventions across society.
--- Going beyond very simple algorithms, some AI-based tools hold out the promise of supporting better causal and probabilistic reasoning in complex domains. ( ① ) Humans have a natural ability to build causal models of the world – that is, to explain why things happen – that AI systems still largely lack. ( ② ) For example, while a doctor can explain to a patient why a treatment works, referring to the changes it causes in the body, a modern machine-learning system could only tell you that patients who are given this treatment tend, on average, to get better. ( ③ ) In these cases, supporting human reasoning with more structured AI-based tools may be helpful. ( ④ ) Researchers have been exploring the use of Bayesian Networks – an AI technology that can be used to map out the causal relationships between events, and to represent degrees of uncertainty around different areas – for decision support, such as to enable more accurate risk assessment.

 --- The rise of large, industrial cities has had social consequences that are often known as urbanism. The city dissolves the informal controls of the village or small town. Most urban residents are unknown to one another, and most social interactions in cities occur between people who know each other only in specific roles, such as parking attendant, store clerk, or customer. Individuals became more free to live as they wished, and in ways that break away from social norms. In response, and because the high density of city living requires the pliant coordination of many thousands of people, urban societies have developed a wide range of methods to control urban behavior. These include regulations that control private land use, building construction and maintenance (to minimize fire risk), and the production of pollution and noise.

Default assumptions are (a) preconceived notions about the likely state of affairs – what we assume to be true in the absence of specific information.

In the absence of specific details, people rely on the stereotype as a default assumption for filling in the (b) blanks. Default assumptions have a tendency, in Hofstadter’s words, to “permeate our mental representations and channel our thoughts.” For instance, given the words “cat,” “dog,” and “chases,” you are likely to think first of a dog chasing a cat. This line of thought (c) reflects a default assumption that, all else being equal, the dog is more likely to chase the cat than the other way around.
Default assumptions are rooted in our socially learned associative clusters and linguistic categories. They are (d) useless in that people cannot always afford the time it would take to consider every theoretical possibility that confronts them. Nonetheless, default assumptions are often wrong. Default assumptions are only one type of language-based categorization. Hofstadter is particularly interested in race-based and gender-based categorization and default assumptions.

We truly hoped that the race would go smoothly. However, it is likely that the heavy rain will make the roads too slippery and dangerous for the racers to run safely. As a result, we have decided to cancel the race. We hope you understand and we promise to hold another race in the near future.

We almost universally accept that playing video games is at best a pleasant break from a student's learning and more often what prevents a student from accomplishing their goals. Games catch and hold attention in a way that few things can. And yet once they have our focus, they rarely seem to offer anything meaningful to help students grow in their lives outside the games.

The position of the architect rose during the Roman Empire, as architecture symbolically became a particularly important political statement. Cicero classed the architect with the physician and the teacher and Vitruvius spoke of ""so great a profession as this."" Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a practicing architect during the rule of Augustus Caesar, recognized that architecture requires both practical and theoretical knowledge, and he listed the disciplines he felt the aspiring architect should master: literature and writing, draftsmanship, mathematics, history, philosophy, music, medicine, law, and astronomy — a curriculum that still has much to recommend it. All of this study was necessary, he argued, because architects who have aimed at acquiring manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position of authority to correspond to their plans, while those who have relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously ""hunting the shadow, not the substance.""",seeking abstract knowledge emphasized by architectural tradition,discounting the subjects necessary to achieve architectural goals,pursuing the ideals of architecture without the practical skills,prioritizing architecture's material aspects over its artistic ones,following historical precedents without regard to current standards,3

The ability to understand emotions — to have a diverse emotion vocabulary and to understand the causes and consequences of emotion — is particularly relevant in group settings. Individuals who are skilled in this domain are able to express emotions, feelings and moods accurately and thus, may facilitate clear communication between co-workers. Furthermore, they may be more likely to act in ways that accommodate their own needs as well as the needs of others (i.e. cooperate). In a group conflict situation, for example, a member with a strong ability to understand emotion will be able to express how he feels about the problem and why he feels this way. He also should be able to take the perspective of the other group members and understand why they are reacting in a certain manner.

The arrival of the Industrial Age changed the relationship among time, labor, and capital. Factories could produce around the clock, and they could do so with greater speed and volume than ever before. A machine that runs twelve hours a day will produce more widgets than one that runs for only eight hours per day - and a machine that runs twenty-four hours per day will produce the most widgets of all. As such, at many factories, the workday is divided into eight-hour shifts, so that there will always be people on hand to keep the widget machines humming. Industrialization raised the potential value of every single work hour - the more hours you worked, the more widgets you produced, and the more money you made - and thus wages became tied to effort and production. Labor, previously guided by harvest cycles, became clock-oriented, and society started to reorganize around new principles of productivity.",shift in the work-time paradigm brought about by industrialization,effects of standardizing production procedures on labor markets,influence of industrialization on the machine-human relationship,efficient ways to increase the value of time in the Industrial Age,problems that excessive work hours have caused for laborers,1

The selfie resonates not because it is new, but because it expresses, develops, expands, and intensifies the long history of the self-portrait. The self-portrait showed to others the status of the person depicted. In this sense, what we have come to call our own ""image"" - the interface of the way we think we look and the way others see us - is the first and fundamental object of global visual culture. The selfie depicts the drama of our own daily performance of ourselves in tension with our inner emotions that may or may not be expressed as we wish.

In the early 1960s, he became an assistant professor at San Fernando Valley State College, where he also served as a coach of its baseball team. Afterwards, he began a full-time sportscasting career in Los Angeles. In 1973, he became the first U.S. sportscaster ever to visit China. He joined NBC Sports in 1975 and remained with the network for about 25 years, covering such big events as the Olympics. He later worked for other major sports broadcasting stations. He made his last live broadcast in 2016 and died the following year at the age of 82. He served as Chairman of the American Sportscaster Association for more than three decades.

Studies in psychology have reported cases in which competitive incentives resulted in lower task effort, and their focus was on the psychological underpinnings of the reduction in motivation.

Literature can be helpful in the language learning process because of the ______ it fosters in readers.
Core language teaching materials must concentrate on how a language operates both as a rule-based system and as a sociosemantic system. Very often, the process of learning is essentially analytic, piecemeal, and, at the level of the personality, fairly superficial. Engaging imaginatively with literature enables learners to shift the focus of their attention beyond the more mechanical aspects of the foreign language system. When a novel, play or short story is explored over a period of time, the result is that the reader begins to 'inhabit' the text. He or she is drawn into the book. Pinpointing what individual words or phrases may mean becomes less important than pursuing the development of the story. The reader is eager to find out what happens as events unfold; he or she feels close to certain characters and shares their emotional responses. The language becomes 'transparent' - the fiction draws the whole person into its own world.",linguistic insight,artistic imagination,literary sensibility,alternative perspective,personal involvement,3

Education, at its best, teaches more than just knowledge. It teaches critical thinking: the ability to stop and think before acting, to avoid succumbing to emotional pressures. This is not thought control. It is the very reverse: mental liberation. Even the most advanced intellectual will be imperfect at this skill. But even imperfect possession of it ______ of being 'stimulus-driven', constantly reacting to the immediate environment, the brightest colours or loudest sounds. Being driven by heuristic responses, living by instinct and emotion all the time, is a very easy way to live, in many ways: thought is effortful, especially for the inexperienced. But emotions are also exhausting, and short-term reactions may not, in the long term, be the most beneficial for health and survival.

The expansion of sports tourism in the twentieth century has been influenced by further developments in transportation. Just as the railways revolutionized travel in the nineteenth century, so the automobile produced even more dramatic changes in the twentieth. The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically. Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain. Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment. The expansion of reasonably priced, good quality accommodation associated with tourism growth has also facilitated the growth of locally based restaurants. As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.",The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically.,"Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain.","Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment.","The expansion of reasonably priced, good quality accommodation associated with tourism growth has also facilitated the growth of locally based restaurants.","As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.",4

In reality, objects do not conform to a linear lifecycle model; instead, they undergo breakdowns, await repairs, are stored away, or find themselves relegated to the basement, only to be rediscovered and repurposed later.
By their very nature, the concepts of maintenance and repair are predominantly examined from a process-oriented perspective. (1) The focus in related scholarly discourse often revolves around the lifespan or lifecycle of objects and technologies. (2) In this context, maintenance and repair are considered practices that have the potential to prolong the existence of objects, ensuring their sustained utilization over an extended period. (3) Krebs and Weber critically engage with anthropomorphic metaphors that imply a biography of things, appropriately highlighting that conventional understanding of the lifecycle of a technology, from its acquisition to its disposal from the household, provides an incomplete definition.

People often assume that synthetic food ingredients are more harmful than natural ones, but this is not always the case. Typically, synthetic ingredients can be made in a precisely controlled fashion and have well-defined compositions and properties, allowing careful evaluation of their potential toxicity. On the other hand, natural ingredients often vary appreciably in their composition and properties depending on their origin, the time of year they were harvested, the climate they experienced throughout their lifetime, the soil quality, and how they were isolated and stored. These variations can make testing their safety extremely difficult - one is never sure about the potential toxicity of minor components that may vary from time to time. In some cases, a natural food component has been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years without causing any obvious health problems and can, therefore, be assumed to be safe.

To whom it may concern, Thank you very much for faithfully responding to our request six months ago and taking corresponding measures. Even after the installation of road traffic safety facilities, we still need more for the safety of our students. It is a problem with the school road, which students use on their way to and from school. The width of the current school road is barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. So, there are risks of collision with vehicles on the road where students walk and accidents if many students flock to the narrow school road. Therefore, we ask you to expand the school road for students' safety. I would appreciate it if you could respond as soon as possible.

One night a buddy and I decided we were going to go find that Big Foot. We were in my old truck and we set off across the fields heading toward the tallest hill.

As we got to the top of the hill, there was a loud thump! My truck sunk down like something heavy had just jumped in the bed. We were too terrified to look in the back.

Placing value on and investing in experiences provides us with a greater sense of vitality. Our experiences make us feel alive and give us greater opportunities to grow. Any time you consider purchasing a new possession, stop yourself and think about what kind of experience it will give you. Ask yourself: How much joy will this bring me? Will the joy be temporary or long-lasting? Will the purchase be something I can share with others? If it becomes clear the purchase will provide only short-term benefit to you, think about an experience you could purchase instead that would provide you with longer-term benefits. For instance, if you have your eye on a new pair of shoes for $150, ask yourself what kind of experience you could enjoy for that same amount.

Giving honest information may be particularly relevant to integrity because honesty is so fundamental in discussions of trustworthiness. Unfortunately, leaders are often reluctant to tell the truth. During times of crisis and change, business leaders are often faced with the challenge of either telling an uncomfortable truth, remaining silent, or downplaying the severity of the situation. There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply ""fill in the gaps"" in their understanding with their own theories about the leader's behavior.

On an antelope's skull, the eye sockets are situated on the side of the head. This is because this animal spends a lot of its time with its head bent down to eat a low-nutrient food: grass.

With the eye sockets at the back of the head and on the side, it can see nearly 360° around itself. The eye of the antelope is also at the back of its head, giving it a long nose.

If the infant's gaze lingered, it suggested that the infant could tell that a similar image was nonetheless different in some way. If the infant, after a week without seeing an image, didn't look at it much when it was shown again, the infant must be able at some level to remember having seen it the week before.

There is no question that losing weight is hard. According to one calculation, you must walk 35 miles or jog for seven hours to lose just one pound. One big problem with exercise is that we don't track it very scrupulously. A study in America found that people overestimated the number of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of four. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as many calories as they had just burned off. As Daniel Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker - equivalent to more than sixty marathons. That's pretty impressive, but here's a reasonable question: how many factory workers look as if they run a marathon every six days? To be cruelly blunt, not many. That's because most of them, like most of the rest of us, replace all those burnt calories, and then some, when they are not working.

Music can be a powerful parental ally during the challenging child-rearing years.

--- In 1890, William James described attention as ""the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought."" Attention is a choice we make to stay on one task, one line of thinking, one mental road, even as attractive off-ramps signal. When we fail to make that choice and allow ourselves to be frequently sidetracked, we end up in ""the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state"" that James said is the opposite of attention. Staying on one road got much harder when the internet arrived and moved much of our reading online. Every hyperlink is an off-ramp, calling us to abandon the choice we made moments earlier. Nicholas Carr, in his 2010 book, grieved his lost ability to stay on one path. Life on the internet changed how his brain sought out information, even when he was off-line trying to read a book. It reduced his ability to focus and reflect because he now craved a constant stream of stimulation: ""Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words.

--- The human desire to make pictures is deeply rooted. At least 64,000 years ago, Neanderthals used colored oxide and charcoal to make paintings of large wild animals, tracings of human hands, and abstract patterns on cave and rock walls. Today, people create images with a multitude of mediums, including photography. What drives this picture-making impulse? Some make pictures for commercial reasons. Others create informational systems or employ scientific imaging tools to visualize the unseen. Artists use images expressionistically, to conceptualize and articulate who they are and how they view the world. However, the fundamental motive for making the vast majority of pictures is a desire to preserve: to document, and therefore honor, specific people, events, and possessions of importance. Regardless of purpose, the making of images persists because words alone cannot always provide a satisfactory way to describe and express our relationship to the world. Pictures are an essential component of how humans observe, communicate, celebrate, comment, and, most of all, remember.

Truly, the engine does not run without the gasoline, but all the intricate parts of the engine are the product of physical architecture, designed and assembled for a reactive purpose long before the gasoline is injected.

--- The social-cognitive revolution at 1 year of age sets the stage for infants' second year of life, in which they begin to imitatively learn the use of all kinds of tools, artifacts, and symbols. For example, in a study by Meltzoff (1988), 14-month-old children observed an adult bend at the waist and touch its head to a panel, thus turning on a light. They followed suit. Infants engaged in this somewhat unusual and awkward behavior, even though it would have been easier and more natural for them simply to push the panel with their hand. One interpretation of this behavior is that infants understood that the adult had the goal of illuminating the light and then chose one means for doing so, from among other possible means, and if they had the same goal, they could choose the same means. Similarly, Carpenter et al.

--- As an ideal of intellectual inquiry and a strategy for the advancement of knowledge, the scientific method is essentially a monument to the utility of error. Most of us gravitate toward trying to prove our beliefs, to the extent that we bother investigating their validity at all. But scientists gravitate toward falsification; as a community if not as individuals, they seek to disprove their beliefs.

However, arguments against poetry having a role to play in philosophical inquiry have tended to focus on poetry's (negative) relationship to truth (or, as John Koethe puts it, poetry's indifference to truth). Although we may accept works of poetry as having philosophical themes, this does not amount to doing philosophy through poetry. One such argument hinges on the non-paraphrasability of poetry and form-content unity. The thought goes, if poetry is to play a role in philosophy, then it needs to be paraphrasable (that is, its content must be separable from its form). The assumption is that paraphrase is a mark of understanding and indicates that some proposition has a fixed meaning and that only a proposition with a fixed meaning can be evaluated in terms of truth or falsity. Poetry resists paraphrase: to change the words is to change the poem.
Some believe in the ability of poetry to (A) philosophy, but for others, its resistance to paraphrasing (B) its philosophical role.",misinterpret - limits,deliver - expands,convey - restricts,reexamine - reinforces,seek - broadens,3

Confident is not the same as comfortable. One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up.

Gold plating in the project means needlessly enhancing the expected results, namely, adding characteristics that are costly, not required, and that have low added value with respect to the targets — in other words, giving more with no real justification other than to demonstrate one's own talent. Gold plating is especially interesting for project team members, as it is typical of projects with a marked professional component — in other words, projects that involve specialists with proven experience and extensive professional autonomy. In these environments specialists often see the project as an opportunity to test and enrich their skill sets. There is therefore a strong temptation, in all good faith, to engage in gold plating, namely, to achieve more or higher-quality work that gratifies the professional but does not add value to the client's requests, and at the same time removes valuable resources from the project.

The need to assimilate values and lifestyle of the host culture has become a growing conflict. Multiculturalists suggest that there should be a model of partial assimilation in which immigrants retain some of their customs, beliefs, and language. There is pressure to conform rather than to maintain their cultural identities, however, and these conflicts are greatly determined by the community to which one migrates. These experiences are not new; many Europeans experienced exclusion and poverty during the first two waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eventually, these immigrants transformed this country with significant changes that included enlightenment and acceptance of diversity. People of color, however, continue to struggle for acceptance. Once again, the challenge is to recognize that other cultures think and act differently and that they have the right to do so.

The primary purpose of commercial music radio broadcasting is to deliver an audience to a group of advertisers and sponsors. To achieve commercial success, that audience must be as large as possible. More than any other characteristics (such as demographic or psychographic profile, purchasing power, level of interest, degree of satisfaction, quality of attention or emotional state), the quantity of an audience aggregated as a mass is the most significant metric for broadcasters seeking to make music radio for profitable ends. As a result, broadcasters attempt to maximise their audience size by playing music that is popular, or — at the very least — music that can be relied upon not to cause audiences to switch off their radio or change the station. Audience retention is a key value (if not the key value) for many music programmers and for radio station management. In consequence, a high degree of risk aversion frequently marks out the ‘successful’ radio music programmer. Playlists are restricted, and often very small.

Before the web, newspaper archives were largely the musty domain of professional researchers and journalism students. Journalism was, by definition, current. The general accessibility of archives has greatly extended the shelf life of journalism, with older stories now regularly cited to provide context for more current ones. With regard to how meaning is made of complex issues encountered in the news, this departure can be understood as a readiness by online news consumers to engage with the underlying issues and contexts of the news that was not apparent in, or even possible for, print consumers. One of the emergent qualities of online news, determined in part by the depth of readily accessible online archives, seems to be the possibility of understanding news stories as the manifest outcomes of larger economic, social and cultural issues rather than short-lived and unconnected media spectacles.

This work, which was reprinted in an expanded edition in 1997, remains a landmark in the field.

Why is the value of place so important? From a historical perspective, until the 1700s textile production was a hand process using the fibers available within a particular geographic region, for example, cotton, wool, silk, and flax. Trade among regions ② increased the availability of these fibers and associated textiles made from the fibers. The First Industrial Revolution and subsequent technological advancements in manufactured fibers ③ added to the fact that fibers and textiles were no longer ""place-bound."" Fashion companies created and consumers could acquire textiles and products made from textiles with little or no connection to where, how, or by whom the products were made. This ④ countered a disconnect between consumers and the products they use on a daily basis, a loss of understanding and appreciation in the skills and resources necessary to create these products, and an associated disregard for the human and natural resources necessary for the products' creation. Therefore, renewing a value on place ⑤ reconnects the company and the consumer with the people, geography, and culture of a particular location.

The suburbs were far more dependent on the automobile, signaling the shift from primary dependence on public transportation to private cars. Soon this led to the construction of better highways and freeways and the decline and even loss of public transportation. With all of these changes came a __________ of leisure. As more people owned their own homes, with more space inside and lovely yards outside, their recreation and leisure time was increasingly centered around the home or, at most, the neighborhood.

An invention or discovery that is too far ahead of its time is worthless; no one can follow. Ideally, an innovation opens up only the next step from what is known and invites the culture to move forward one hop. An overly futuristic, unconventional, or visionary invention can fail initially (it may lack essential not-yet-invented materials or a critical market or proper understanding) yet succeed later, when the ecology of supporting ideas catches up. Gregor Mendel's 1865 theories of genetic heredity were correct but ignored for 35 years. His sharp insights were not accepted because they did not explain the problems biologists had at the time, nor did his explanation operate by known mechanisms, so his discoveries were out of reach even for the early adopters. Decades later science faced the urgent questions that Mendel's discoveries could answer. Now his insights __________.

Prior to photography, __________. While painters have always lifted particular places out of their ‘dwelling’ and transported them elsewhere, paintings were time-consuming to produce, relatively difficult to transport and one-of-a-kind. The multiplication of photographs especially took place with the introduction of the half-tone plate in the 1880s that made possible the mechanical reproduction of photographs in newspapers, periodicals, books and advertisements. Photography became coupled to consumer capitalism and the globe was now offered ‘in limitless quantities, figures, landscapes, events which had not previously been utilised either at all, or only as pictures for one customer’. With capitalism's arrangement of the world as a ‘department store’, ‘the proliferation and circulation of representations … achieved a spectacular and virtually inescapable global magnitude’. Gradually photographs became cheap mass-produced objects that made the world visible, aesthetic and desirable. Experiences were ‘democratised’ by translating them into cheap images. Light, small and mass-produced photographs became dynamic vehicles for the spatiotemporal circulation of places.

Although organizations are offering telecommuting programs in greater numbers than ever before, acceptance and use of these programs are still limited by a number of factors. ① These factors include manager reliance on face-to-face management practices, lack of telecommuting training within an organization, misperceptions of and discomfort with flexible workplace programs, and a lack of information about the effects of telecommuting on an organization's bottom line. ② Despite these limitations, at the beginning of the 21st century, a new “anytime, anywhere” work culture is emerging. ③ Care must be taken to select employees whose personal and working characteristics are best suited for telecommuting. ④ Continuing advances in information technology, the expansion of a global workforce, and increased desire to balance work and family are only three of the many factors that will gradually reduce the current barriers to telecommuting as a dominant workforce development. ⑤ With implications for organizational cost savings, especially with regard to lower facility costs, increased employee flexibility, and productivity, telecommuting is increasingly of interest to many organizations.

The intuitive ability to classify and generalize is undoubtedly a useful feature of life and research, but it carries a high cost, such as in our tendency to stereotype generalizations about people and situations.
(A) Intuitively and quickly, we mentally sort things into groups based on what we perceive the differences between them to be, and that is the basis for stereotyping. Only afterwards do we examine (or not examine) more evidence of how things are differentiated, and the degree and significance of the variations.
(B) Our brain performs these tasks efficiently and automatically, usually without our awareness. The real danger of stereotypes is not their inaccuracy, but their lack of flexibility and their tendency to be preserved, even when we have enough time to stop and consider.
(C) For most people, the word stereotype arouses negative connotations: it implies a negative bias. But, in fact, stereotypes do not differ in principle from all other generalizations; generalizations about groups of people are not necessarily always negative.

Plants show finely tuned adaptive responses when nutrients are limiting. Gardeners may recognize yellow leaves as a sign of poor nutrition and the need for fertilizer.
(A) In contrast, plants with a history of nutrient abundance are risk averse and save energy. At all developmental stages, plants respond to environmental changes or unevenness so as to be able to use their energy for growth, survival, and reproduction, while limiting damage and nonproductive uses of their valuable energy.
(B) Research in this area has shown that plants are constantly aware of their position in the environment, in terms of both space and time. Plants that have experienced variable nutrient availability in the past tend to exhibit risk-taking behaviors, such as spending energy on root lengthening instead of leaf production.
(C) But if a plant does not have a caretaker to provide supplemental minerals, it can proliferate or lengthen its roots and develop root hairs to allow foraging in more distant soil patches. Plants can also use their memory to respond to histories of temporal or spatial variation in nutrient or resource availability.

Because the manipulation of digitally converted sounds meant the reprogramming of binary information, editing operations could be performed with millisecond precision.
The shift from analog to digital technology significantly influenced how music was produced. First and foremost, the digitization of sounds — that is, their conversion into numbers — enabled music makers to undo what was done. ① One could, in other words, twist and bend sounds toward something new without sacrificing the original version. ② This “undo” ability made mistakes considerably less momentous, sparking the creative process and encouraging a generally more experimental mindset. ③ In addition, digitally converted sounds could be manipulated simply by programming digital messages rather than using physical tools, simplifying the editing process significantly. ④ For example, while editing once involved razor blades to physically cut and splice audiotapes, it now involved the cursor and mouse-click of the computer-based sequencer program, which was obviously less time consuming. ⑤ This microlevel access at once made it easier to conceal any traces of manipulations (such as joining tracks in silent spots) and introduced new possibilities for manipulating sounds in audible and experimental ways.

In the case of specialists such as art critics, a deeper familiarity with materials and techniques is often useful in reaching an informed judgement about a work.
Acknowledging the making of artworks does not require a detailed, technical knowledge of, say, how painters mix different kinds of paint, or how an image editing tool works. ① All that is required is a general sense of a significant difference between working with paints and working with an imaging application. ② This sense might involve a basic familiarity with paints and paintbrushes as well as a basic familiarity with how we use computers, perhaps including how we use consumer imaging apps. ③ This is because every kind of artistic material or tool comes with its own challenges and affordances for artistic creation. ④ Critics are often interested in the ways artists exploit different kinds of materials and tools for particular artistic effect. ⑤ They are also interested in the success of an artist's attempt embodied in the artwork itself — to push the limits of what can be achieved with certain materials and tools.

Research for historical fiction may focus on under-documented ordinary people, events, or sites. Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds “flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.” Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never — for lack of archives — been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn.

People have an anti-persuasion radar or defense system that goes off when someone is trying to persuade them. The more something or someone disagrees with them, the less likely they are to listen. Consequently, one reason change is so hard is that people are unwilling to even consider information that goes against their beliefs. As a result, when dealing with opposing viewpoints, being a bit more indirect can often be more effective. Rather than starting with information, start by encouraging people to be more open minded and receptive. This is why expressing doubt can help. Showing that we're conflicted or uncertain makes us seem less threatening. Expressing doubt about one's own view acknowledges that conflicting beliefs are valid, making the other side feel validated and more willing to listen. It recognizes that issues are complicated or nuanced, which increases receptiveness. Uncertainty signals an openness to other perspectives. So particularly when issues are controversial or people are dug in, expressing a little doubt can actually be more persuasive.",불확실한 상황을 피하려면 계획을 철저히 세워야 한다.,상대를 변화시키려면 정확한 정보를 먼저 제공해야 한다.,누군가 자신을 일방적으로 설득하려 하면 이를 경계해야 한다.,자신의 주장을 관철하고자 할 때는 본론으로 바로 들어가야 한다.,나와 다른 의견에 설득력이 있으려면 간접적인 태도를 보여야 한다.,5

The unity of science and philosophy in the old classical sense was perhaps best described by the famous tree of Descartes: The roots of this tree corresponded to metaphysics (the intelligible principles), the trunk to physics (statements of intermediate generality), and the branches and fruit to what we would call applied science. He regarded the whole system of science and philosophy as we today regard science alone; he felt that the metaphysical principles were ultimately justified by their ""fruits,"" not merely by their self-evidence. What we today call applied science consisted for him not only in mechanics but also in medicine and ethics. The difficulty was that from the general principles of Cartesian or Aristotelian science-philosophy no results could be derived which were precisely in agreement with observation, but these principles seemed to be intelligible and plausible. So the tree was cut in the middle. For the derivation of technical results, it was necessary to start from the physical principles in the trunk. Science in the new sense was to think only of how the fruits would develop from the trunk without regard to the roots.",Science detached itself from philosophical foundations and shifted to deriving outcomes based on physical principles.,Metaphysics became the first priority above all as practical results took precedence over intelligible theory.,Results consistent with the observation were the utmost priority in Cartesian science-philosophy.,Applied science moved toward being less reliant on both metaphysical and physical principles.,Science de-emphasized ethical considerations in favor of raw observations.,1

Good narrative writing is often as much technique as it is talent, sometimes more. The best narrative nonfiction writers often turn to time-honored tools of fiction writers for effect: plot and pacing, character and drama, and, yes, suspense. And they understand that a good story just can't spread out in all directions like a serving of spaghetti. The story needs form, shape, a structure designed to pull the reader from start to finish. ""The craftsmanship of the writer is no less beautiful than that of the cabinet maker or the builder of temples or fine violins,"" writes Jon Franklin. Yes, this may sound grandiose, but the emphasis on craftsmanship is pure pragmatism: a knowledge of the basic structures that narrative science writers use to build an effective story. I think of this approach as journalistic architecture.

If you want to bring something into shared reality for the purpose of social coordination, you have to describe it, or at the very least label it. Even the ideally objective pursuit of science is unable to escape the framing effects of language. Like all collective culture, science is constructed on report, reason, debate, negotiation, justification, consensus, and, most important, coordination. And all of these things depend on language. Even something as fundamental as particle physics depends on language in a particular way. I don't mean that particle physics wouldn't exist if we didn't describe it. Particle physics is part of brute reality and so it will carry on independent of any human agreement or understanding of what it is. But consider this remark by Michael I. Jordan, referring to the ""infinite potential well"" model, which studies how a single particle behaves in a small, enclosed space: ""A particle in a potential well is optimizing a function called the Lagrangian function. The particle doesn't know that. There's no algorithm running that does that. It just happens.

In fact, humans are known to have the largest and most visible sclera - the ""whites"" of the eyes - of any species. This fact intrigues scientists, because it would seem actually to be a considerable obstacle: imagine, for example, the classic war movie scene where the soldier dresses in camouflage and paints his face with green and brown color - but can do nothing about his noticeably white sclera, beaming bright against the jungle. There must be some reason humans developed it, despite its obvious costs. In fact, the advantage of visible sclera - so goes the ""cooperative eye hypothesis"" - is precisely that it enables humans to see clearly, and from a distance, which direction other humans are looking. Michael Tomasello showed in a 2007 study that chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos - our nearest cousins - follow the direction of each other's heads, whereas human infants follow the direction of each other's eyes.

By around 1900, he writes, ""technical reproduction had reached a standard that not only permitted it to reproduce all transmitted works of art and thus to cause the most profound change in their impact upon the public."" The ④ ability to copy mechanically ""substituted a plurality of copies for a unique existence,"" Benjamin argued. In addition to transforming art and the public's relation to it, Benjamin asserted that mechanical reproduction has the power to rend traditions by interfering with the authority of objects ""embedded in the fabric of tradition.""

He illustrates it with the example of someone looking through a keyhole who suddenly finds himself caught by someone watching him. The look of the other is always unnerving, Sartre argues, not only because we momentarily recognize ourselves in it through our imagination of their judgment of us but also because we don't. We can always step back, challenge our perception of others' perceptions of ourselves, or explain them away - but we don't know what these perceptions really are.

This observation is related to the idea that visual space is not open but ends at visible surfaces or, indeed, the sky. Uexküll and Kriszat (1934) suggested that this is realized as a hard limit, which they call the ""farthest plane."" If an observed person or object would walk beyond this farthest plane, it would no longer be perceived as moving further away, but rather as shrinking in size. This observation is actually quite common; if looking down from a high tower, for example, cars or even houses on the ground below may appear as if they were toys: that is, shrunk, presumably because they are perceived at the distance of the farthest plane while subtending a visual angle that corresponds to a larger distance.

What would a language be like if it didn't make any simplifications or generalizations?
(A) There might be some superintelligent race of beings that could know such a language, but they would have to know virtually everything in the world to learn all these names. Human language has taken a different route—many fewer names, with a loss of precision, but a basic vocabulary that is readily acquired. However, this fact is not simply a compromise with our limited cognitive capacity.
(B) By using the same word for different objects, we're communicating information about those things. Calling two different-looking things ""spider"" communicates that they probably have eight legs, weave nests, eat insects, and other noticeable details, which we would not know if we gave them all their own separate names.
(C) It would be a language in which every word was a proper noun.

An alternative view is that we make sense of the sensations we feel and the facial expressions we see only when we attach words to them - we develop rather than inherit our emotional concepts.
We experience emotions as different bodily sensations, such as a beating heart and sweaty palms; we recognize emotions in others by their facial expressions and behaviour. (1) One prominent idea is that we are born with a fixed set of basic emotions that are universal within our species, notably happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger.

(③) Key evidence is that children are unable to categorise facial expressions as representing different emotions until they have acquired a lexicon of words for emotions. (④) Before having such words, faces that we might view as angry, sad or fearful are all categorised together as 'unpleasant'.

The rest of the time, even as individuals are trying their best to think through issues, motivational goals may bias their thought processes and bias their reasoning.
Everyone likes to think of themselves as behaving in an unbiased fashion most of the time.

And yet, overwhelming psychological research suggests that such unbiased rationality is actually a fairly elusive quality in humans. (1) Much of the time people are on automatic pilot.

It may be assumed that meta-algorithmics, that is, the creation of algorithms that generate other algorithms, is a human creation as well. A human programmer must have composed the first algorithm that, in turn, generates new algorithms and as such the initial programmer must be in control of the original idea. However, this is not necessarily true. Unlike humanly conceived ideas, where the author is the intellectual owner of the idea, algorithms are processes that define, describe, and implement a series of actions that in turn produce other actions. During the transfer of actions it is possible for a discrepancy to occur between the original intention and the actual result. If that happens then, by definition, the author of the algorithm is not in control of, and therefore does not own intellectually from that point on, the resulting process. Theoretically, ownership of an idea is intrinsically connected to the predictability of its outcome, that is, to its intellectual control. Therefore, in the absence of human control the ownership of the algorithmic process must be instead credited to the device that produced it, that is, to the computer.

A visual scene can set up our emotional response. Suspense is driven by a sense of calm with the anticipation of impending terror. Indeed, anticipation or expectations play a key role in driving our emotions. The Russian silent filmmaker Lev Kuleshov considered such contextual influences. He interspersed shots of an actor exhibiting a neutral expression with shots of a child's coffin or a plate of soup. This same ""neutral"" expression was interpreted differently depending on what image preceded it. Thus, the same expression appeared to show sorrow or hunger, depending on the context. Psychological studies of the Kuleshov effect have confirmed the impact of the social context on emotion. For example, if a person smiles at you and then the smile turns into a neutral expression, that person will appear somewhat grumpy or disappointed. Conversely, if a person first looks angry and then the expression turns into a neutral expression, the person looks somewhat pleasant or positive.

Complete protection of all life and the entire built environment in all earthquakes is still a distant dream. However, efforts are on to have a built environment in which loss of life is minimized, and lifelines and infrastructure continue to function during and after an earthquake disaster. Construction activities in seismically prone and hazardous areas that are vulnerable to different damaging effects of earthquakes are best avoided. Most of the time such situations are unavoidable; in that case appropriate strengthening measures are required. Structures should be preferably made on firm ground. For construction in soft soil, the ground should be strengthened, and the foundations should be sufficiently deep, wide, and strong. Subsequently, application of appropriate interventions regarding earthquake-resistant design of structures goes a long way in saving human lives.

The improvisational collaboration of the entire group translates moments of individual creativity into group innovation. Allowing the space for this self-organizing emergence to occur is difficult for many managers because the outcome isn't controlled by the management team's agenda and is therefore less predictable.

According to its dictionary definition, an anthem is both a song of loyalty, often to a country, and a piece of 'sacred music', definitions that are both applicable in sporting contexts. This genre is dominated, although not exclusively, by football and has produced a number of examples ① where popular songs become synonymous with the club and are enthusiastically adopted by the fans. More than this they are often spontaneous expressions of loyalty and identity and, according to Desmond Morris, have 'reached the level of something approached a local art form'. A strong element of the appeal of such sports songs ③ is that they feature 'memorable and easily sung choruses in which fans can participate'.

How people behave often depends on what others do.

Writing lyrics means shaping the meaning of something which, if left as instrumental music, would remain undefined; there is a change of the level of expression. That's one reason why for many songwriters 'lyric' seems to be the hardest word. Picture this scene: a songwriter at the piano, or with a guitar, plays with chords and creates an emotion and atmosphere that is creatively inspiring. Our songwriter invents a melody to go with this mood. Then comes the moment where words are required, and that means getting specific. This sad- or happy-sounding chord progression must now direct its general sadness or happiness to a particular human situation. A lyric is the place where the emotional suggestions of pure music are defined as _______________ human concerns and events. It's like a piece of translation, from one medium into another.

Like faces, sometimes movement can _______________. For example, toys that seem to come alive fascinate children. In my day, one of the popular toys was a piece of finely coiled wire called a ""Slinky."" It could appear to walk by stretching and lifting up one end over another down an incline, a bit like an acrobatic caterpillar. The attraction of the Slinky on Christmas Day was the lifelike movement it had as it stepped down the stairs before someone trod on it or twisted the spring and ruined it for good. Toys that appear to be alive are curiosities because they challenge how we think inanimate objects and living things should behave. Many toys today exploit this principle to great effect, but be warned: not all babies enjoy objects that suddenly seem lifelike. This anxiety probably reflects their confusion over the question, ""Is it alive or what?"" Once babies decide that something is alive, they are inclined to see its movements as purposeful.

Perhaps not surprisingly, given how long magicians have been developing their craft, a lot of creativity in magic is of the tweaking variety - some of the most skilled and inventive magicians gained fame by refining the execution of tricks that have been known for decades, or sometimes centuries. Nevil Maskelyne, one of magic's old masters, claimed that ""the difficulty of producing a new magical effect is about equivalent to that of inventing a new proposition in Euclid."" Whether it's because there's little that's completely new, or for some other reason, magicians seem to worry less about imitation. They do, however, worry a lot about traitors- those magicians who expose the secrets behind a trick to the public. Once a trick is exposed in this way, its value as ""magic"" is destroyed, and this harms everyone in the industry. For this reason, magicians' norms are focused mostly on punishing magicians who expose tricks to the public - even if the trick is the exposer's own invention.

Certain hindrances to multifaceted creative activity may lie in premature specialization, i.e., having to choose the direction of education or to focus on developing one ability too early in life. However, development of creative ability in one domain may enhance effectiveness in other domains that require similar skills, and flexible switching between generality and specificity is helpful to productivity in many domains. Excessive specificity may result in information from outside the domain being underestimated and unavailable, which leads to fixedness of thinking, whereas excessive generality causes chaos, vagueness, and shallowness. Both tendencies pose a threat to the transfer of knowledge and skills between domains. What should therefore be optimal for the development of cross-domain creativity is support for young people in taking up creative challenges in a specific domain and coupling it with encouragement to apply knowledge and skills in, as well as from, other domains, disciplines, and tasks.",창의성을 개발하기 위해서는 도전과 실패를 두려워하지 말아야 한다.,전문 지식과 기술을 전수하려면 집중적인 투자가 선행되어야 한다.,창의적인 인재를 육성하기 위해 다양한 교육과정을 준비해야 한다.,특정 영역에서 개발된 창의성이 영역 간 활용되도록 장려해야 한다.,조기 교육을 통해 특정 분야의 전문가를 지속적으로 양성해야 한다.,4

In an era when museums are forced to increase their earnings, they often focus their energies on modernising their galleries or mounting temporary exhibitions to bring more and more audiences through the door. In other words, as museums struggle to survive in a competitive economy, their budgets often prioritise those parts of themselves that are consumable: infotainment in the galleries, goods and services in the cafes and the shops.

Hyper-mobility - the notion that more travel at faster speeds covering longer distances generates greater economic success seems to be a distinguishing feature of urban areas, where more than half of the world's population currently reside. By 2005, approximately 7.5 billion trips were made each day in cities worldwide. In 2050, there may be three to four times as many passenger-kilometres travelled as in the year 2000, infrastructure and energy prices permitting. Freight movement could also rise more than threefold during the same period. Mobility flows have become a key dynamic of urbanization, with the associated infrastructure invariably constituting the backbone of urban form. Yet, despite the increasing level of urban mobility worldwide, access to places, activities and services has become increasingly difficult.

To the extent that an agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts, we say that the agent lacks autonomy. A rational agent should be autonomous - it should learn what it can to (A) compensate / prepare for partial or incorrect prior knowledge. For example, a vacuum-cleaning agent that learns to foresee where and when additional dirt will appear will do better than one that does not. As a practical matter, one seldom requires complete autonomy from the start: when the agent has had little or no experience, it would have to act (B) purposefully / randomly unless the designer gave some assistance. So, just as evolution provides animals with enough built-in reflexes to survive long enough to learn for themselves, it would be reasonable to provide an artificial intelligent agent with some initial knowledge as well as an ability to learn. After sufficient experience of its environment, the behavior of a rational agent can become effectively (C) independent / protective of its prior knowledge. Hence, the incorporation of learning allows one to design a single rational agent that will succeed in a vast variety of environments.",compensate - randomly - protective,compensate - purposefully - protective,prepare - randomly - protective,compensate - randomly - independent,prepare - purposefully - independent,4

One of the common themes of the Western philosophical tradition is the distinction between sensual perceptions and rational knowledge. Since Plato, the supremacy of rational reason is based on the assertion that it is able to extract true knowledge from experience. As the discussion in the Republic helps to explain, perceptions are inherently unreliable and misleading because the senses are subject to errors and illusions. Only the rational discourse has the tools to overcome illusions and to point towards true knowledge. For instance, perception suggests that a figure in the distance is smaller than it really is. Yet, the application of logical reasoning will reveal that the figure only appears small because it obeys the laws of geometrical perspective.

The evolutionary process works on the genetic variation that is available. It follows that natural selection is unlikely to lead to the evolution of perfect, 'maximally fit' individuals. Rather, organisms come to match their environments by being 'the fittest available' or 'the fittest yet': they are not 'the best imaginable'. Part of the lack of fit arises because the present properties of an organism have not all originated in an environment similar in every respect to the one in which it now lives. Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism's remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics - evolutionary 'baggage' - that subsequently constrain future evolution. For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column. Moreover, much of what we now see as precise matches between an organism and its environment may equally be seen as constraints: koala bears live successfully on Eucalyptus foliage, but, from another perspective, koala bears cannot live without Eucalyptus foliage.

Melody is one of the primary ways that our expectations
are controlled by composers. Music theorists have identified
a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a
melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note
should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of
stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the
melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for
the melody to ""want"" to return to the jumping-off point; this
is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap
was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us
closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic ""home.""
In ""Over the Rainbow,"" the melody begins with one of the
largest leaps we've ever experienced in a lifetime of music
listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation,
and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing
the melody back toward home again, but not by too much

information about how a place changed over time, who the
major personalities were and the significant events that
occurred there; or at least those selected by the author for
inclusion. ③ If the author is writing from his personal

adding creative twists to a story that already exists. ④ Unless
a book is extremely large or the district chosen is very small,

As a social species, should we not all be synchronized and
therefore awake at the same time to promote maximal human
interactions? Perhaps not. Humans likely evolved to co-sleep
as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples.
Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such
genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing
preferences can be understood. The night people in the group
would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not
waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning people, on the
other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and
woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is
only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just
four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the
chance for eight hours of sleep. That's potentially a 50 percent
increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on
a biological trait—here, the useful variability in when
individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up—

The early Earth collided with numerous other masses during
its formation; indeed, the proto-Earth is thought to have
sustained a massive impact with a Mars-sized body named
'Theia'. The Moon probably formed from this collision about 100
million years after the formation of the solar system. This impact
is thought to have knocked the Earth off its 'daily' rotational axis
so that the Earth now tilts about 23.4° away from its orbital axis
around the Sun, although there is a slight 'wobble' of a few
degrees. This 23.4° tilt, as we orbit around the Sun, causes our
yearly cycle of the seasons. During part of the year, the northern
hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun (summer) and the southern
hemisphere is tilted away (winter). Six months later, the
situation is reversed. Critically, the Moon's gravitational pull
stabilizes the Earth's axial tilt, moderating the degree of wobble.
This has produced a relatively stable climate on Earth for billions
of years, and many believe that life on Earth would never have
got started without this stabilization by the Moon. To rephrase a
song from the 1970s, we are all children of the Moon.

they are not evidence for me, because they don't provide me with
good reasons for believing that I am confronted with a case of the

Some multinational IT companies, which generate revenue
through digital advertising and data collection, have been accused
of exploiting loopholes in international tax regimes to shift
profits to low-tax territories. This practice, known as profit
shifting, allows corporations to pay minimal taxes in the
countries where they operate, depriving governments of critical
revenue. In response, several countries have attempted to impose
digital services taxes on tech giants, but these efforts have been
met with fierce resistance. Corporations argue that such taxes
unfairly target their business models, while governments contend
that they are necessary to level the playing field and ensure that
corporations contribute their fair share to the public good. These
disputes over taxation illustrate the broader challenge that
governments face in regulating multinational corporations.
Meanwhile, traditional regulatory frameworks, designed for
nation-bound businesses, are often ill-equipped to address the
complexities of global operations. As a result, corporations are
frequently able to avoid or undermine regulations, operating in a
legal gray area where national laws cannot easily reach them.

According to philosopher Habermas, the public sphere is 'the
sphere of private people come together as a public'. Habermas's
basic praise of the private sphere contradicts that of the ancients.
It is not a realm of mere particularity; it harbours its own
universals. It is in fact equal in value to the public sphere. As
Habermas explains, 'the public sphere has a complementary
relation to this private sphere, from which the public, as the
bearers of the public sphere, is recruited'. Habermas pictures the
private sphere as the waiting room in which people develop the
consciousness that enables them to step out in public. This
involves self-confidence, critical faculties, opinion and
will-formation, and so on. It is in the private sphere, especially
the privacy of one's own home, that one is able to find one's very
identity, to achieve existential meaning and a personal conception
of the good. It is the lifeworld out of which the public sphere is
generated, enabling defects in the economic and political systems
to be confronted. Privacy thus ______ persons for the public

There is a view of culture that rejects the idea that culture
can be owned. This view is exemplified by Xuanzang, the Chinese
traveler who went to India and brought back Buddhist
manuscripts. It was embraced by Arab and Persian scholars who
translated Greek philosophy. It was practiced by countless
scribes, teachers, and artists who found inspiration far outside
their local culture. Culture, for these figures, is made not only
from the resources of one community but also from encounters
with other cultures. It is crafted not only from the lived
experience of individuals but also from borrowed forms and ideas
that help individuals understand and articulate their experience in
new ways. When seen through the lens of culture as property,
these figures might appear to be unwelcome visitors,
appropriators, even thieves. But they pursued their work with
humility and dedication because they understood instinctively
that ______; they knew
that false ideas of property and ownership impose limits and
constraints, leading to impoverished forms of expression.

An expense that reinforces the honesty of a signal is its
potential reputational cost. For example, a signal might be
considered costly when there's a greater risk that a dishonest
signaller will receive a penalty as a result. The most powerful
signals in nature aren't directed one-to-one. The brightly coloured
poison frog and the impressive tail of the peacock are for all to
see. The more witnesses of a signal, the higher the risk is for a
dishonest signaller. Interestingly, the arrival of digital
communications (specifically targeted ads online), is limiting this
reputational risk, theoretically reducing the impact of a
communicator's signal. Writer Don Marti hypothesises that, in
communications, ""targeting breaks signalling."" This means that
when you see an advertisement that's targeting you alone, it's
more like a cold call than a public message. It doesn't carry the
same credible information about the seller's intentions because
it's free of reputational cost. It's maybe no surprise that deceptive
sellers have far more success online than through more public
communication channels. To build trust, often it's not just about
seeing the message, it's knowing that _______.

When someone recounts their story of some tragedy, the other
responds with 'I feel for you. That happened to me.' Through
identification, the object of the emotional response shifts from the
other person to oneself. Such identification fails to count as empathy
since it is not a genuine instance of sharing in the emotional
response of the other (with temporarily activated concern for the
other) but is a simple projection of the self onto the other. It is
merely one's own imagined or remembered-emotional response.
To put this in other words, there is a forgetting that it is not you but
the other who is in the situation. What happens in the case of
empathy is an attempt to appreciate a situation from another's point
of view _______

Almost all life shows a 24-hour pattern of activity and rest,
even bacteria. It seems very likely that this rhythm evolved as a
result of living on a planet that rotates once every 24 hours and
that the resultant changes in light, temperature and food
availability forced an adaptive evolutionary response. ① Diurnal
and nocturnal species have evolved numerous specializations that
have allowed them to perform best under the different conditions
of light or dark, but, critically, not both. ② Life seems to have
made an evolutionary 'decision' to be active at a specific part of
the day/night cycle, and, as a result, those species that are
specialized to be active during the day will not be particularly
effective at night. ③ Light is the primary factor controlling the
body's rhythms, and irregularly timed light is a common issue
that disrupts the sleep-wake cycle. ④ In the same way, nocturnal
animals that are perfectly adapted to move around and hunt under
dim or no light fail miserably in the day. ⑤ The struggle for
existence has forced species to become specialists and not
generalists, and no species can operate with the same
effectiveness across the 24-hour light/dark environment.

Flowering plants and bees are not strict mutualists.
Flowering plants don't want to give up all their precious
pollen to undesirable pollinators or even to generally
dependable pollinating bees.
(A) Instead, they deceive male bees into thinking a particular
orchid flower is a receptive, ready, and waiting female of
their species to make them pollinate. Why not? They
produce the same chemical scents and even sort of look like
those female bees.
(B) A small fraction of a flower's pollen grains must make their
way to other flowers to ultimately produce seeds and foster
new generations of plants. Bees, on the other hand, would
like to collect all the pollen and not give any of it up.
(C) This difference leads to cheaters in the system. Some
nectar-robbing bees cut slits or holes at the bases of
tube-shaped flowers and never deposit pollen on stigmas.
They are anti-pollinators. Orchids and a few other flowering
plants offer no food to bee pollinators.

The bond of friendship may solve a problem known as the
banker's paradox. When you are facing financial ruin and most
need a loan, the bank is unlikely to grant you one as you
represent a terrible credit risk. On the other hand, when things
are going well the bank is only too happy to offer you funds.
(A) Why would a non-relative come to your aid, with a greatly
reduced chance of being paid back the favour? The evolution
of friendship provides a solution to the dilemma. The
oxytocin-mediated bond between friends makes them
irreplaceable to each other.
(B) So if a friend falls seriously ill, rather than abandoning them
to find someone else with whom to engage in reciprocal
altruism, you have an emotional stake in their well-being that
compels you to help them pull through. Friendship may have
developed in human evolution as a form of insurance.
(C) This same dynamic would also have posed a deep problem for
reciprocal altruism in the world of our ancestors. Individuals
may be least likely to receive help when they most need it,
because they are least able to reciprocate. [3점]

Yet this, the increasingly collective nature of science, is often
missed in stories of individual genius, whether Newton sitting
under an apple tree or Einstein writing at night after his job.
For most of history science was secretive, obscure and often
considered indistinguishable from magic. ( ① ) Modern science by
contrast combines observation, interpretation and action in forms
that collectivize the knowledge gained and institutionalizes them in
labs, centres, disciplines, funds and stored memories. ( ② ) As a
collective, science polices itself, as happened in 2018 when a
Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, announced the birth of twin girls with
edited genomes, and was met with a storm of disapproval. (3)
This open and collective nature was understood early in the history
of modern science. ( ④ ) Joseph Glanvill was one of its first
theorists, arguing in the 1660s that 'free and ingenious exchange of
the reasons of our particular sentiments' is the best method of
discovering truth and improving knowledge. ( ⑤) But the more we
know, the more collective science looks, dependent on networks of
collaborators, supporters and colleagues. [3점]

In one revealing series of studies, researchers from the
Julius-Maximilians University of Würzburg, Germany, enrolled
test subjects in a well-known experiment called ""die under
the cup."" In the experiment, participants make a series of die
rolls under a cup, the results of which only they can see, and
then report their results anonymously. Participants were told
they would earn money depending on the outcome of their
rolls, with higher rolls rewarded more favorably. To ensure
appropriate conditions, the researchers varied the time
participants had to report their results. In the first round,
they asked participants to report their results immediately. In
the second, they were instructed to do so after a short delay.
The results were clear, supporting what many researchers
have long suspected: the results reported immediately were
more honest than those reported after a delay, suggesting
that honesty is a more instinctive response and showing that
dishonesty takes greater cognitive effort.

Questions of morality are often pushed to the side in legislative
debate, labeled too controversial, too difficult to answer, or,
worst of all, irrelevant to the project. But, in fact, the moral
questions of taxation are at the very heart of the creation of tax
laws. Rather than irrelevant, moral questions are fundamental
to the imposition of tax. Tax is the application of a society's
theories of distributive justice. Economics can go a long way
towards helping a legislature determine whether or not a
particular tax law will help achieve a particular goal, but
economics cannot, in a vacuum, identify the goal. Creating tax

Environmental learning occurs when farmers base decisions
on observations of ""payoff"" information. They may observe
their own or neighbors' farms, but it is the empirical results they
are using as a guide, not the neighbors themselves. They are
looking at farming activities as experiments and assessing such
factors as relative advantage, compatibility with existing
resources, difficulty of use, and ""trialability"" - how well can it
be experimented with. But that criterion of ""trialability"" turns
out to be a real problem; it's true that farmers are always
experimenting, but working farms are very flawed laboratories.
Farmers cannot set up the controlled conditions of professional
test plots in research facilities. Farmers also often confront
complex and difficult-to-observe phenomena that would be
hard to manage even if they could run controlled experiments.

Not only musicians and psychologists, but also committed
music enthusiasts and experts often voice the opinion that the
beauty of music lies in an expressive deviation from the exactly
defined score. Concert performances become interesting and
gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the
information printed in the score. In his early studies on musical
performance, Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only
rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way. Within the
same metric structure, there is a wide potential of variations in
tempo, volume, tonal quality and intonation. Such variation is
based on the composition but diverges from it individually. We
generally call this 'expressivity'. This explains why we do not
lose interest when we hear different artists perform the same
piece of music. It also explains why it is worthwhile for
following generations to repeat the same repertoire. New,
inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding,
which serves to enrich and animate the music scene.",How to Build a Successful Career in Music Criticism,Never the Same: The Value of Variation in Music Performance,The Importance of Personal Expression in Music Therapy,Keep Your Cool: Overcoming Stage Fright When Playing Music,What's New in the Classical Music Industry?,2

Leon Festinger was an American social psychologist. He was

As a graduate student at the University of Iowa, Festinger was

graduating from there, he became a professor at the Massachusetts

University, where he continued his work in social psychology.
His theory of social comparison earned him a good reputation.

A striving to demonstrate individual personality through

educated to work as individuals, and design literature
contains countless references to 'the designer'. Personal
flair is without doubt an absolute necessity in some product
categories, particularly relatively small objects, with a low
degree of technological complexity, such as furniture,
lighting, small appliances, and housewares. In larger-scale
projects, however, even where a strong personality exercises
powerful influence, the fact that substantial numbers of
designers are employed in implementing a concept can
easily be overlooked. The emphasis on individuality is
therefore problematic rather than actually designing,
many successful designer 'personalities' function more as
creative managers. A distinction needs to be made between
designers working truly alone and those working in a group.

Climate change experts and environmental humanists alike
agree that the climate crisis is, at its core, a crisis of the
imagination and much of the popular imagination is shaped by
fiction. In his 2016 book The Great Derangement, anthropologist
and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between
imagination and environmental management, arguing that
humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part
because fiction (a) fails to believably represent it. Ghosh
explains that climate change is largely absent from
contemporary fiction because the cyclones, floods, and other
catastrophes it brings to mind simply seem too ""improbable""
to belong in stories about everyday life. But climate change
does not only reveal itself as a series of (b) extraordinary
events. In fact, as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel
Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out, environmental change
can be ""imperceptible""; it proceeds (c) rapidly, only occasionally
producing ""explosive and spectacular"" events. Most climate
change impacts cannot be observed day-to-day, but they
become (d) visible when we are confronted with their
accumulated impacts.
Climate change evades our imagination because it poses
significant representational challenges. It cannot be observed
in ""human time,"" which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff
Orlowski, who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and

Early astronomers saw and learned more from eclipses and other forms of shadow than from direct observation. In Galileo's time, the empiricist's insistence on direct observation as the only legitimate way of knowing limited what could be learned about the cosmos, and the medievalist allowance for extraperceptual insights had nothing to contribute to what we would consider scientific inquiry. Galileo's breakthroughs came in part from his understanding of how to use shadows to extend his powers of observation. At the time he trained his telescope on Venus, it was believed the planet shone with its own light and moved in an orbit independent of the sun. Galileo saw that the planet was in partial shadow as it went through its phases, and thus had to be a dark body. He also realized from the logic of the shadow that Venus orbited the sun, since all phases from new to full could be observed from earth. The end of the Ptolemaic system came quickly thereafter, a shadow thus shedding light on the ordering of the cosmos.

On this suggestion, the claim ""You ought to keep your promises,"" because it uses ""ought,"" is ethical. “An atom is small,"" because it uses ""is,"" is nonethical. Yet, despite being commonly invoked, this is-ought test is seriously deficient. Some is-statements have ethical content and some ought-statements do not.

The table above shows the percentage of perceived and actual food waste of household groceries and the gap between those percentages for selected countries from 2017 to 2018. ① The U.S. showed the highest percentage of actual food waste among the countries, and almost one quarter of all food there went to the bin. ② While Canada, Poland and Denmark recorded the same figures in the percentage of perceived food waste, Canada was the only country which exceeded twenty percent in actual food waste among those three countries. ③ In perceived food waste, Mexico was just one percentage point higher than Russia, but the percentage of actual food waste in Mexico was more than three times that in Russia. ④ Switzerland had the biggest gap between perceived and actual food waste percentages, and this gap was more than twice as big as that of Germany. ⑤ Of all the countries above, the only one where the percentage of actual food waste was lower than that of perceived food waste was Denmark.",1번 이미지,2번 이미지,3번 이미지,4번 이미지,5번 이미지,3

Donald Griffin was an American biophysicist and animal behaviourist known for his research in animal navigation, acoustic orientation, and sensory biophysics. During his childhood, he was influenced by his uncle, who was a Harvard professor of biology. Griffin received a Ph.D. in zoology from Harvard University in 1942. He demonstrated that bats emit high-frequency sounds with which they can locate objects as small as flying insects. In 1965, he became a professor at Rockefeller University in New York and a research zoologist for the New York Zoological Society. After he retired from Rockefeller University in 1986, he didn't stop his research: he continued to present papers at national and international meetings. In the late 1970s Griffin argued that animals might possess the ability to think and reason. Although his claim sparked much controversy in the science community, there is no question that he radically opened up the field of animal cognition.",미국의 생물 물리학자이자 동물 행동학자이다.,어렸을 때 수학 교수인 삼촌에게 영향을 받았다.,박쥐가 고주파음으로 사물의 위치를 파악함을 증명했다.,Rockefeller University 퇴직 후 연구를 멈추지 않았다.,동물이 생각하고 추론하는 능력을 지녔을 수 있다고 주장했다.,2

The world's first complex writing form, Sumerian cuneiform, followed an evolutionary path, moving around 3500 BCE from pictographic to ideographic representations, from the depiction of objects to ① that of abstract notions. Sumerian cuneiform was a linear writing system, its symbols usually ② set in columns, read from top to bottom and from left to right. This regimentation was a form of abstraction: the world is not a linear place, and objects do not organize ③ themselves horizontally or vertically in real life. Early rock paintings, thought to have been created for ritual purposes, were possibly shaped and organized ④ to follow the walls of the cave, or the desires of the painters, who may have organized them symbolically, or artistically, or even randomly. Yet after cuneiform, virtually every form of script that has emerged has been set out in rows with a clear beginning and endpoint.

It's likely that for a very long time people managed to survive with draped animal pelts and then began roughly sewing these together. Ultimately, though, the ① advantages of using woven fabric for clothing would have become obvious. A fur pelt offers ② inadequate thermal protection if someone is sitting still, but once on the move or in strong winds, this is less true, because pelts aren't shaped close to the body. The more air gets between the body and the clothing, the less effective it is at trapping an insulating layer of air close to the skin. In fact, the insulating properties of clothing ③ decrease very much when walking quickly. Clothing also needs to be breathable, because damp clothes are bad at keeping the wearer warm and become very heavy. Woven fabrics are more breathable than fur and, when specifically tailored to the body, make excellent internal layers, ④ preventing cold air from getting direct access to the skin's surface. Thus the ability to create woven clothing would have offered material advantages to our early ancestors once they had left Africa for ⑤ cooler areas.

Contrary to popular opinion, woodpeckers don't restrict themselves to rotten trees, and they often start construction in healthy trees. Just like us, woodpeckers want the place where they bring up their families to be solid and durable. Even though the birds are well equipped to hammer away at healthy wood, it would be too much for them to complete the job all at once. And that's why they take a months-long break after making a hole that may be only an inch or two deep, hoping fungi will pitch in. As far as the fungi are concerned, this is the invitation they have been waiting for, because usually they can't get past the bark. In this case, the fungi quickly move into the opening and begin to break down the wood. What the tree sees as a coordinated attack, the woodpecker sees as a(n) ________.

The urban environment is generally designed so as not to make contact with our skin. We do not push through bushes on our way to school or work. Roads and sidewalks are kept clear of obstacles.

Most of our time is not even spent outside. ""Outside"" is often just a space we go through to get ""inside."" Our time is largely spent indoors, where architecture and design collude to provide an environment as lacking as possible in tactile stimulation.

The ideal sound quality varies a lot in step with technological and cultural changes. Consider, for instance, the development of new digital audio formats such as MP3 and AAC. Various media feed us daily with data-compressed audio, and some people rarely experience CD-quality (that is, technical quality) audio. This tendency could lead to a new generation of listeners with other sound quality preferences. Research by Stanford University professor Jonathan Berger adds fuel to this thesis. Berger tested first-year university students' preferences for MP3s annually for ten years. He reports that each year more and more students come to prefer MP3s to CD-quality audio. These findings indicate that listeners gradually become accustomed to data-compressed formats and change their listening preferences accordingly. The point is that while technical improvements strive toward increased sound quality in a technical sense (e.g., higher resolution and greater bit rate), listeners' expectations do not necessarily follow the same path. As a result, ""improved"" technical digital sound quality may in some cases lead to a(n) ________.

Birds use many techniques to save energy when they are flying, most of which are tricks to stay aloft without flapping.
(A) When it reaches the top, the bird bends its wings and glides in the direction it wants to travel, searching for the next thermal. All soaring birds take advantage of thermals, but some species, like the Broad-winged Hawk, are specialists and in the right conditions can travel hundreds of miles with almost no flapping.
(B) Riding updrafts to gain altitude is one of the most conspicuous. Bare ground such as fields or parking lots absorbs more heat from the sun, and as air near the ground warms up it rises.
(C) This creates a column of rising warm air a thermal-reaching hundreds or even thousands of feet high. A soaring bird can sense the air movement and fly in circles to stay in the column. It simply fans its wings and tail and lets the rising air carry it up like an elevator.

Under such circumstances, recycling previously composed music was the only way to make it more durable.
In the classical period of European music, much musical material was de facto considered common property. ( ① ) When Antonio Vivaldi presented in Venice his opera Rosmira fedele, the score was actually a pastiche in which, among his own ideas, musicologists later identified ideas by George Frederic Handel, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Johann Adolph Hasse, among others. ( ② ) As far as recycling of segments of music initially written for other occasions into new pieces is concerned, it needs to be observed how today composers are discouraged from doing so for a number of reasons. ( ③ ) A practical one is that each new piece is sure to remain available, in score or as an audio file. ( ④ ) In the 18th century, on the contrary, once the particular occasion for performing a new piece was over, it became almost impossible to ever hear it again. ( ⑤ ) And if new pieces also contained ideas from other composers, that would re-enforce European musical traditions by increasing the circulation of melodies and harmonic patterns people loved to hear.

There is a key difference between how humans and other intelligent animals learn. In a very telling experiment done by evolutionary psychologist Mike Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, a puzzle box containing a treat is given to a human toddler and a chimpanzee. Neither is able to get the treat out. He then demonstrates a multistep process of pulling and pushing pegs that eventually releases the treat. Among the motions, he includes an obviously nonsensical step-patting his head three times before the last step. Both the toddler and the chimp are able to copy his actions and get the treat, but only the toddler includes the head-patting step. The chimp, seeing this is not relevant to getting the treat, omits it from the routine. The human, however, unquestioningly copies all the steps. The toddler trusts the human teaching her to have a reason for each step in this situation, and so she overcopies. In fact, the less clear the goal of the procedure, the more carefully and precisely the human child will imitate even irrelevant steps.

It is true of your social perceptions as well-your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine's taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn't because the subjects consciously believed that the higher-priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn't true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper.

Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well-being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true the second language is associated with post-immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love. And many are somewhere in between, having a mix of positive and negative experiences associated with each language.",다중 언어 환경은 모국어 학습 발달을 지연시킨다.,모국어 실력이 뛰어날수록 외국어를 습득하는 속도가 빠르다.,다중 언어 사용자는 사용하는 언어에 따라 다르게 느끼고 반응한다.,부정적인 어휘가 긍정적인 어휘보다 감정에 미치는 영향이 크다.,긍정적인 감정을 나타내는 어휘량이 문화권마다 다르다.,3

--- Sociologist Brooke Harrington said if there was an E = mc² of social science, it would be SD > PD, ""social death is more frightening than physical death."" This is why we feel deeply threatened when a new idea challenges the ones that have become part of our identity. For some ideas, the ones that identify us as members of a group, we don't reason as individuals; we reason as a member of a tribe. We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups.

If you depend on no one except yourself to satisfy your desires, you will have no master other than yourself and you will be free.

--- Japanese used to have a color word, ao, that spanned both green and blue. In the modern language, however, ao has come to be restricted mostly to blue shades, and green is usually expressed by the word midori. When the first traffic lights were imported from the United States and installed in Japan in the 1930s, they were just as green as anywhere else. Nevertheless, in common parlance the go light was called ao shingoo, perhaps because the three primary colors on Japanese artists' palettes are traditionally aka(red), kiiro(yellow), and ao. The label ao for a green light did not appear so out of the ordinary at first, because of the remaining associations of the word ao with greenness. But over time, the difference between the green color and the dominant meaning of the word ao began to feel awkward. Nations that are less assertive might have opted for the solution of simply changing the official name of the go light to midori. Not so the Japanese.

One says she has to work very hard and the other uses goal setting to create a plan to stay on track and work on specific skills where she is lacking. Both are working hard but only the latter is working smart. It can be frustrating for athletes to work extremely hard but not make the progress they wanted. What can make the difference is drive - utilizing the mental gear to maximize gains made in the technical and physical areas. Drive provides direction (goals), sustains effort (motivation), and creates a training mindset that goes beyond simply working hard. Drive applies direct force on your physical and technical gears, strengthening and polishing them so they can spin with vigor and purpose. While desire might make you spin those gears faster and harder as you work out or practice, drive is what built them in the first place.

--- Considerable work by cultural psychologists and anthropologists has shown that there are indeed large and sometimes surprising differences in the words and concepts that different cultures have for describing emotions, as well as in the social circumstances that draw out the expression of particular emotions. However, those data do not actually show that different cultures have different emotions, if we think of emotions as central, neurally implemented states. As for, say, color vision, they just say that, despite the same internal processing architecture, how we interpret, categorize, and name emotions varies according to culture and that we learn in a particular culture the social context in which it is appropriate to express emotions. However, the emotional states themselves are likely to be quite invariant across cultures. In a sense, we can think of a basic, culturally universal emotion set that is shaped by evolution and implemented in the brain, but the links between such emotional states and stimuli, behavior, and other cognitive states are plastic and can be modified by learning in a specific cultural context.

In some cases, when an individual detects a predator, its best response is to seek shelter.

--- Mobilities in transit offer a broad field to be explored by different disciplines in all faculties, in addition to the humanities. In spite of increasing acceleration, for example in travelling through geographical or virtual space, our body becomes more and more a passive non-moving container, which is transported by artefacts or loaded up with inner feelings of being mobile in the so-called information society. Technical mobilities turn human beings into some kind of terminal creatures, who spend most of their time at rest and who need to participate in sports in order to balance their daily disproportion of motion and rest. Have we come closer to Aristotle's image of God as the immobile mover, when elites exercise their power to move money, things and people, while they themselves do not need to move at all? Others, at the bottom of this power, are victims of mobility-structured social exclusion. They cannot decide how and where to move, but are just moved around or locked out or even locked in without either the right to move or the right to stay.

The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible. Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving.

--- Most opposition to wilderness preservation doesn't come from environmentalists but from corporate interests and developers. When wild places are designated as wilderness, they are closed to most commercial activities and residential or infrastructure development. There is thus frequently an economic cost to wilderness preservation. Some critics claim that when wilderness and economic interests clash, economic interests should normally prevail. This argument, even if it is sound, won't exclude all wilderness preservation efforts, because some wilderness areas have little economic value. But a deeper problem with the argument is that it views nature from a human-focused and excessively economic point of view. Allowing economic considerations to outweigh all other forms of value is inconsistent with the biocentric reasons that support wilderness preservation. Thus, while it certainly makes sense to weigh the economic costs of wilderness protection, especially when such costs are high, the biocentric values underlying wilderness preservation exclude viewing economic considerations as the most important.",야생 보호 구역 보존의 생명 중심적 가치는 경제적 고려에 우선한다.,자연과의 공존을 고려한 상업 활동이 기업에 경제적 이익을 가져다준다.,야생 보호에 있어 우선적으로 고려하는 가치는 문화에 따라 다양하다.,야생 보호는 경제적 가치와 상관없이 모든 생물에 똑같이 적용된다.,야생의 보호와 회복을 위한 비용 부담은 공동체 모두의 몫이다.,1

--- During the day, a molecule called adenosine builds up in your brain. Adenosine binds with receptors on nerve cells, or neurons, slowing down their activity and making you feel drowsy. But caffeine is also able to bind with these receptors, and by doing so it blocks adenosine's effect, making your neurons fire more and keeping you alert. Caffeine also activates a gland at the base of your brain. This releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands on your kidneys to produce adrenaline, causing your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to rise. If, however, your daily caffeine intake is consistent, your brain will adapt to it. Your brain is like, 'Okay, every morning I'm getting this caffeine that's binding to these receptors and blocking adenosine from binding to them.' So your brain creates extra receptors to give adenosine more of an opportunity to bind with them and have its usual effect. And more adenosine is also produced to counteract the caffeine. That's why it takes more and more caffeine to have the same effect.",what your brain does for regular hormone production,consequences of sleep deprivation caused by caffeine,connection between brain health and hormone balance,efforts to overcome the constant temptation of caffeine,how your brain adapts to a steady caffeine consumption,5

--- When viewed from space, one of the Earth's most commanding features is the blueness of its vast oceans. Small amounts of water do not indicate the color of these large bodies of water; when pure drinking water is examined in a glass, it appears clear and colorless. Apparently a relatively large volume of water is required to reveal the blue color. Why is this so? When light penetrates water, it experiences both absorption and scattering. Water molecules strongly absorb infrared and, to a lesser degree, red light. At the same time, water molecules are small enough to scatter shorter wavelengths, giving water its blue-green color. The amount of long-wavelength absorption is a function of depth; the deeper the water, the more red light is absorbed. At a depth of 15m, the intensity of red light drops to 25% of its original value and falls to zero beyond a depth of 30m. Any object viewed at this depth is seen in a blue-green light. For this reason, red inhabitants of the sea, such as lobsters and crabs, appear black to divers not carrying a lamp.",We Should Go Green with the Ocean Exploration,Various Tones of Water Our Deceptive Eyes Show Us,How Deep-Sea Microorganisms Affect the Ocean's Color,Why So Blue: The Science Behind the Color of Earth's Oceans,"The Bigger Volume Water Has, the Lower Temperature It Gets",4

This species’ pitcher has a rigid, horizontal lid with an exposed underside that produces nectar, luring insects to land on it. When a raindrop strikes the lid’s top, the lid jolts downward and throws any unsuspecting visitor into digestive juices below. Researchers used x-ray scans to analyze cross sections of the pitchers when the lid is raised, lowered, and in a neutral position. Their results revealed a structural weak point in the pitcher’s neck: when a raindrop hits the lid, the weak spot folds in and forces the lid to quickly move downward, similar to a diving board. The weak point makes the pitcher’s body bend and bounce back in a specific, consistent way, so the lid rises back up without bouncing too far — unlike a typical leaf’s chaotic vibration when struck by rain.",exploit external energy for a purpose,hide itself with help of the environment,coordinate with other plants to trap insects,change its shape to absorb more rain water,modify its hunting strategy on a regular basis,1

The data showed that when people were not distracted by chatting with companions, they actually had a stronger emotional response to the art. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with chatting and letting the art slide past, but think of the inspiration those museum visitors missed out on. Then apply that to life in general. When we surround ourselves with other people, we’re not just missing out on the finer details of an art exhibition. We’re missing out on the chance to reflect and understand ourselves better. In fact, studies show that if we never allow ourselves to be alone, it’s just plain harder for us to learn. Other research found that young people who cannot stand being alone were less likely to develop creative skills like playing an instrument or writing because the most effective practice of these abilities is often done while alone.

--- There are a number of human characteristics that would seem to be disadvantageous yet continue to survive, generation after generation. One example is color blindness.

On the other hand, the men out hunting don’t much rely on being able to contrast red from green. Most of the animals they are hunting have fur or feathers that help them hide.

Good teachers know that learning occurs when students compare what they already know with the new ideas presented by the teacher or textbook. It is the students who decide whether or not to reconstruct their conceptions; therefore, teaching should be student centered rather than teacher centered. This means that students should be actively involved in making and interpreting analogies. If we believe that analogy use is an effective way to help students think and learn, then it makes sense to help students generate their own analogies or reconstruct the teacher's analogies to fit in with their own experiences.",학습 내용은 학생 수준에 맞는 난이도로 구성되어야 한다.,다양한 사례를 활용하여 학생의 이해를 도와야 한다.,교사는 수업 중 학생과 상호 작용을 많이 해야 한다.,교육 활동에서 이론보다 실습의 비중을 더 높여야 한다.,유추를 해내고 재구성하는 과정이 학생 중심이어야 한다.,5

While user habits are a boon to companies fortunate enough to generate them, their existence inherently makes success less likely for new innovations and startups trying to disrupt the status quo. The fact is, successfully changing long-term user habits is exceptionally rare. Altering behavior requires not only an understanding of how to persuade people to act but also necessitates getting them to repeat behaviors for long periods, ideally for the rest of their lives. Companies that succeed in building a habit-forming business are often associated with game-changing, wildly successful innovation. But like any discipline, habit design has rules that define and explain why some products change lives while others do not. For one, new behaviors have a short half-life, as our minds tend to return to our old ways of thinking and doing. Experiments show that lab animals habituated to new behaviors tend to regress to their first learned behaviors over time.

Despite numerous studies on the influence of mediated agendas on politics, most studies examine text only as if media only deliver words. These studies looked at how reporters, analysts, and commentators verbally describe and criticize the candidates. But they often neglect another important source of influence: visuals. As some communication scholars said, ""Stories are often complex combinations of visual and verbal content - all too often the visual information is so powerful that it overwhelms the verbal."" The challenge of tackling visuals to examine their influence is multifaceted. The difficulties of gathering and coding visual data and of attributing impact to specific parts of images have no doubt caused veritable scholars to shy away. But the potential impact of visuals on people's perceptions is simply too important to ignore.

Despite excellent training, actors inevitably experience the visceral life of their characters, even if it is for brief moments during a performance. Self-perceptions are altered during the course of a performance, and even more so during long performance seasons. For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character's personality with the actor's personality. Audience attribution errors may increase distress in the actor, including fearing that their personality identity is not stable.",criteria for evaluating an actor's performance,difficulties in portraying complicated characters,background knowledge for appreciating the play,confusion of identity between actor and character,psychological barriers between actors and the audience,4

There is a story about F. Yates, a prominent UK statistician. During his student years at St. John's College, Cambridge, Yates had been keen on a form of sport. It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John's College has a massive neo-Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled.",A Scary Legend About the Statues at St. John's College,A Student Who Solved a Problem of His Own Making,Standards of Beauty Varying from Person to Person,A Smart Professor Who Identified a Criminal,A Success Story of a Mysterious Architect,2

Herbert Shelton was born on October 6, 1895 in Wylie, Texas. As a child, Shelton took an interest in animals, especially their habits when sick as compared to when well. Shelton attended Bernarr Macfadden's College of Physcultopathy in Chicago and interned at Crane's Sanatorium in Elmhurst, Illinois. In 1921, he graduated from the American School of Naturopathy with a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Shelton claimed that cooking food denatures it, and that a healthy body has the ability to restore itself from illness without medical intervention. Although heavily criticized by his contemporaries for advocating fasting over medical treatment, Shelton's work served as an early influence for the raw food movement. A pacifist, Shelton was jailed in 1917 for making an anti-draft statement in public during the height of World War I. By 1972, at the age of 77, Shelton became bedridden from Parkinson's disease.

Surprisingly, consciousness might not be as crucial to creativity as we like to think. There are several different types of creativity - some of them conscious, some of them unconscious. Creativity can happen when you (a) deliberately try to create something or it can happen in your sleep. In any case, Arne Dietrich, a neuroscientist, believes that the creative brain might work much like software. Neuroscientists suspect that creativity is essentially about (b) discovery rather than anything mystical-driven by a mechanical process in the brain that generates possible solutions and then eliminates them systematically. He believes our tendency to dismiss computational creativity as (c) inferior to our own comes from an ingrained dualism in human culture. 'We are overvaluing ourselves and underestimating them,' he says. As a neuroscientist, Dietrich says he tackles the brain as a machine - and does not see machine creativity as different. Considered in this way, the idea that the human brain has a unique claim to creative talents seems a (d) proper perspective. Will others accept that idea? The trick is to stop trying to compare computer artists to human ones. If we can (e) embrace computer creativity for what it is and stop trying to make it look human, not only will computers teach us new things about our own creative talents, but they might become creative in ways that we cannot begin to imagine.",Machines That Create Redefine Creativity,The New Way Machines Learn and Think,How Brain Works During Unconsciousness,Potential Limits of Artificial Intelligence,High Technology Weakens Creativity,1

(A) One day my father hired three young men to harvest the crop. At the end of the day (a) he gathered them around to pay them. ""What do I owe you, John?"" my dad asked the first young man he had hired. ""Fifty-five dollars, Mr. Burres,"" John said. Dad wrote him a check for fifty-five dollars. ""What do I owe you, Michael?"" (b) he asked the second young man who had worked the same number of hours as John. ""You owe me seventy-five dollars,"" Michael said.
(B) Again my father was surprised. (c) He asked for clarification. ""And how did you arrive at that figure?"" The third young man, like the other two, had been hired for the same job and had put in equal time. ""Well,"" said Nathan, ""I didn't charge you for the lunch break since your wife prepared and served lunch. I didn't have gas expenses since I came with my buddies. So the actual number of hours worked brings my pay to thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents."" My father wrote him out a check for one hundred dollars.
(C) Dad then looked at the three young men—stricken silent by my father's actions—all of whom were a bit bewildered by the differing amounts on their individual check. ""I always pay a man his worth, boys. Where I come from we call that equal pay for equal worth."" (d) He looked benevolently at the three young men and in his typical fatherly style added, ""The values in a man create the value of a man.""
(D) With a look of surprise, my dad asked quietly, ""How do you figure that, Michael?"" ""Oh,"" said Michael, ""I charge from the time I get into my car to drive to the job site, until the time I get back home, plus gas mileage and meal allowance."" ""Meal allowance – even if we provide the meals?"" my dad said. ""Yup,"" replied Michael. ""I see,' said my dad, writing him a check for the seventy-five dollars (e) he requested. ""And what about you, Nathan?"" Dad inquired.
